People going back to Facebook is full circle. Hilarious.,AlZarqawi,1688657453.0,jqwfq61,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3
"Just as a heads up - the reason threads isn't launching in the eurozone is simply because it isn't fully fleshed out as an independent app and so it uses IG profile and data. EU regulators will not allow Meta to ""cross-pollinate"" data from different platforms, so threads will not be available there until the data and infrastructure is separated.

Meta like companies leverage a lot of other companies for their digital ecosystem (AWS, Azure, GCP, CloudFlare, Akamai, and so on) and that's before we consider that your data could be shared in many other places for marketing purposes. 

All Facebook (and anyone their size really) can do with data a deletion request from a user; is to guarantee that this data is removed from the places they directly have control over and that they will make no attempt to retrieve it from external sources. if I'm not mistaken the process I just described complies with GDPR regulation.

"Threads is super bare-bones right now. You can tell they sort of rushed this out to capitalize on the anti-Musk appetite out there and they have a lot of work to do to add some fairly basic features to Threads. Which they have already confirmed will be coming but it’s going to take some time. Likely several months.

If Bluesky can have a hard-launch in the next 2-3 months, and if they already have all the standard features, then I could still see them being extremely successful and overtaking both Threads and Twitter. Despite the astronomical amount of users that Threads has gotten in the past 24 hours, I have no doubt that many people who signed up today are rightly feeling uneasy about signing up for another Meta-owned platform. But of course, at the moment Meta is looking WAY better than Musk/Twitter so a lot of people are going along with it due to a lack of other options.

If another option becomes available and offers the same level of user experience that people have become accustomed to on Twitter, then I do think a lot of people will happily switch over and eventually settle on a new app (like Bluesky). So while this is not ideal for Bluesky, they still have a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on this moment. They just need their app to be good, and to come before Threads can implement several missing features and before users begin to entrench themselves on Threads.",yourecreepyasfuck,1688693442.0,jqyw1aj,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3

"Not really. They do use Whatsapp a lot (which technically is a facebook subsidiary...), but in lots of places a majority of people don't use facebook, just because it's a sort of public self promotion that isn't particularly natural or wanted, and that extends broadly over most age groups. And it's whatsapp because it became the default way of ""texting for free and sending pics"", for no other reason than inertia.

For most people facebook is at BEST synonymous with corporate entities advertising by circumventing the advertising monetization practices (which btw is at the core of the recent waves of the plattforms finding ways to cash in on things kicked off by Musk and Twitter)

I personally LITERALLY don't know anyone with a facebook page. And that includes my parents generation, my generation and their kids generation. With ONE exception, and that is exactly that kind of ""advertising interface"" for their business interests that theoretically eats into the advertising revenue of the platform.

But then again where I live the whole concept of self promotion that plattforms LIKE facebook provide runs counter to basic understandings of what ""privacy"" means.

Maybe the better phrasing of your point would have been ""outside of the US those that DO engage with that kind of service do it with facebook instead of the myriad of other options available""? Because that I could see. But then at least you would pay lipservice to the very real baseline shift of ""not engaging with any of that as a matter of principle"".

Not even Model 3 can match G6 range and efficiency, and it’s a smaller sedan vs a SUV.

Moreover, they routinely break laws, and knowingly peddle in misinformation to shape public opinion so that it helps them achieve their business objectives. I refuse to have any part in that.

I have seen people on here and elsewhere raise the prospect of Embrace, Extend, Extinguish, but I really don't think that's likely to happen in the same way it happened for e.g. XMPP with Google Talk ending support.

What does it do? It ensures that EU citizens data is controlled under appropriate policies to protect and handle the data (such as no cross pollination, in the Threads example). EU citizens have the right to request the erasure of their data (right to be forgotten) from any org that stores their data and the org must comply. Users also have the right to decline or object to use of their data (with exception to legal/law reinforcement). There are a ton of other articles within the regulation about how processors must comply with restrictions and requirements of the data storing companies, etc. It bundles it all up nicely and makes data management policies very consistent across the entire EU, compared to trying to address each individual country’s requirements before it was implemented.

Additionally, any breaches of personally identifiable data (name, address, ID numbers, and anything else that could be used to identify a person) must be communicated to an oversight board within 72hours and communicated to their users. Heavy fines are levied for data breaches/leaks/non-compliance. As an example, in 2023, Ireland levied a fine of €1.2 billion against Meta, because EU citizen data was transferred to the U.S. without adequate data protections.

This is why some states, like California, have started to implement their own data protection policies, but the US is woefully behind in this area and our data is basically taken without consent, raped, and sold widespread to virtually anyone with the money to buy it. A good rule of thumb is that if a service/platform is free - you are the product.",scotchdouble,1688746276.0,jr1foqa,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3

"I don't see how the fediverse is going to grow much beyond where it is now without interoperability with bigger platforms. And if other platforms are pressured to follow Meta, Meta won't be the only big fediverse player in town. 

One of the main reasons Meta explicitly gave for why they are pursuing federation and interoperability with ActivityPub is to give users the ability to migrate away from Meta's services if they choose to. Meta has lots of very talented developers that are also likely to contribute upstream to the ActivityPub project to make these kinds of migrations a more seamless process. 

It could be all talk, but Meta's promises have been pretty unambiguous: 

> We’re committed to giving you more control over your audience on Threads – our plan is to work  with ActivityPub to provide you the option to stop using Threads and transfer your content to another service. Our vision is that people using compatible apps will be able to follow and interact with people on Threads without having a Threads account, and vice versa, ushering in a new era of diverse and interconnected networks. If you have a public profile on Threads, this means your posts would be accessible from other apps, allowing you to reach new people with no added effort.

EDIT: I also don't see much incentive for users that are already on (non-Threads) fediverse instances to migrate to Threads. So at the very least, the broader fediverse is extremely unlikely to shrink if Meta drops the protocol.",ruaor,1688657099.0,jqwetbi,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3
"It's extremely unlikely that Meta attempting to EEE ActivityPub will result in a decrease in ActivityPub adoption relative to where it is today. IMO, the future of ActivityPub as a protocol depends largely on how other big social media orgs react to Meta's move. Tumblr is already adopting ActivityPub and I could easily see Twitter/Reddit following suit with more pressure from their competitors and their users. If no individual platform owns the standard or is the primary adopter of it, they can't control it.

Hard disagree. Not only does voting with your dollar not work, its what corporations want - for you to feel like the onus is on you to make the ""right"" choice, and that you have the freedom to choose.

Does someone on a tight budget (which is most Americans) really have the luxury to shop only at retailers that are ethical, or are they just trying to get by day to day? Similarly, if all my friends and family are on Facebook and that's my primary means of keeping in touch with them, I'm going to keep using that platform.

There's nothing contradictory about using the services of a monopolistic business and complaining about their practices. It's funny how evergreen this meme is.

> Soon, we are planning to make Threads compatible with ActivityPub, the open social networking protocol established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body responsible for the open standards that power the modern web.

Meta will be able to serve ads to any of its first party users, and it will probably be able to build a very large user base given the ease of signing up compared to other ActivityPub instances. Brand accounts could potentially gain wider reach if non-Threads users follow them.

">as far as advertising revenue being their main source of income, don't make me laugh.

Advertising revenue was almost 90% of twitters total revenue in 2021, the last full year before musk acquired it. They had around 5 billion dollars of total revenue in 2021, and 4.46 billion of that came from advertising.  Twitter Blue doesn't even come close to replacing this revenue.  

https://mashable.com/article/half-of-twitter-blue-earliest-subscribers-no-longer-subscribed

https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-pushes-twitter-blue-fails-to-win-over-subscribers-2023-4

They would need twitter blue subs in the tens of millions, held across an entire year, to make up for the lost ad revenue.  They aren't even remotely close to that, and only have around 1-2% of the necessary amount of subs. On top of that, retention of those who sign up has been poor.  Their churn rate of people cancelling twitter blue is massive. 

The verification system before was intentionally designed to make sure that businesses and notable people were verified as being who they claimed to be.  Elon functionally destroyed that system and replaced it with one that has notably allowed people to repeatedly impersonate businesses and people.  

>you can't pretend people are ""exterminating minority groups"" when the reality is quite the opposite.

I don't think Facebook is \*really\* all that concerned about Mastodon, this is about exerting pressure on other social media orgs, then Meta will serve ads alongside Tumblr posts, tweets, etc., for its first party users.",ruaor,1688663614.0,jqwvn93,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3

"I agree that Tesla's success had a lot to do with software, but what I'm saying is that it's a very different kind of software - mostly embedded, basically, same as SpaceX. The product is a car, or a space vehicle, and software is just used to make it work. In Twitter's case, the software itself is the product in a much more direct way.

Also, to write embedded software you're generally hiring from a completely different talent pool and dealing with very different kinds of issues.

It may seem like writing software to pilot a car or spaceship would be so much more demanding that running a social media website would be child's play by comparison, but it really doesn't work like that, because many of the issues are completely different.

One difference is that for Tesla or SpaceX, you can test the functionality without involving ""users"", and by the time users are involved, the major kinks have hopefully been worked out. (Tesla's autopilot notwithstanding, although that gives some idea of Musk's approach and in hindsight, was a red flag.)

With Twitter, sure you can test the software before releasing it (although it's not clear how much they're doing that now), but you're not going to find out how successful it is until the users actually interact with it. That's a very different model, and the success criteria are much more fuzzy and unpredictable. Instead of ""does it work"", it's ""do users like it"".

Musk has no track record of success in software of the latter category.

>I'll still give him two years before I judge.

That's a valid point, but there are a lot of signs that he's messed up in a way that Twitter won't fully be able to recover from. 

Meta's Threads is perhaps the biggest example of that: basically, Musk opened up a major market opportunity for the biggest social media company in the world - nearly 20x Twitter in market cap - to start eating his lunch.",goj1ra,1688846803.0,jr6xdcs,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3
"I think Threads hasn't actually turned on the federation yet. A lot of Mastodon instances are planning on blocking them from the outset.

I personally am sort of ambivalent, deleted my Instagram and Facebook and would never sign up for this Meta thing but am willing to interact with its' users through an app that only shares posts not metadata.

There's a possibility that the load from its' users might essentially DDOS some of the bigger instances with traffic so I understand that concern.",BronzetownBlues,1688686625.0,jqyhecy,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3

"Seems like this is almost more of a beta on Meta's part than being fully open.  Not surprised that some instances are planning on blocking Threads, though.  

I'm in the same boat not wanting to directly have a Threads account.  I'll check through some other method if I'm really curious but Twitter isn't really my thing.  Generally I'll just check Reddit for any pertinent tweets regarding news and sports news.",niomosy,1688687070.0,jqyiecc,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3
Ok so we are in agreement that we can take actions that happen to help EvilCorp without wanting EvilCorp to succeed. Now we can go back to the original question and ask GGGGGGP why he thinks everyone desires that Meta have a monopoly.,vehementi,1688748167.0,jr1kj9o,t5_2qh16,t3_14s7ft3
