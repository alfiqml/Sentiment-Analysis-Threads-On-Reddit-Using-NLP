Threads woulda failed so bad if Elon wasn’t being a weirdo
"Of all the shit Elon has pulled, few are worse than forcing me to root for Zuck."
More importantly will the advertisers follow. Twitter no longer looks like something that advertisers would want to put their money into.
"Just a reminder, Musk paid $44 BILLION for a piece of doo doo, that he has run into the ground.  Billlllion"
"I don’t want Zucc to win, I just want Elon to lose."
"Everytime i open that app, i see the home feed and I have NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON OR WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE AND WHY I'M READING THEIR ""THREADS"".Please, give me an empty feed if no one im following posted anything."
Lessons will be learnt for other social media networks which have a user base that are begging for somewhere else to go. Fuck u/spez! Can't wait to see this happen to Reddit in the near future.
Imagine opening your arms to mark zuckerberg as your savior **lol**
Already a better succes than metaverse. And probably a fraction of the investment. Do we need another twitter tho. 70M signups could just as well be all meta/instagram users.
"Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at HarvardZuck: Just ask.Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?Zuck: People just submitted it.Zuck: I don't know why.Zuck: They ""trust me""Zuck: Dumb fucks."
Trading one evil for a lesser evil...
"Sign ups dont matter at all, people are just signing up to see what it's like, doesn't mean they'll be active users by the end of the month"
"Account signups doesn’t mean user retention, and after using threads, i highly doubt elon is sweating"
"Threads will never beat Twitter if it doesn’t allow Porn, simple as that."
"I mean when twitter already did half the job itself, it’s not  hard to follow through with the final nail in the coffin"
“Never let a good crisis go to waste.”
How many apps do you need to communicate with the same people?
Touch grass folks
I signed up with no real intent to use just to piss off Musk

"Now let us use it in a browser. Not all of us are glued to our phones all day, some of us are glued to computer screens."
Leaving Twitter for Threads is like being on fire and walking into a bath of hydrochloric acid.
"Threads is kinda boring. THe problem with ""sanitized"" ""nice"" internet is its just gonna be everyone hawking their brand. No one likes hanging out on Linkedin because its obvious everyone is being fake as fuck and just trying to get a good job."
Everyone i know seems to be jumping on the bandwagon. No way i’m giving meta another way to feed off my personal data. But i am thankful they made a separate app for this. Instagram in its current state is a huge mess with all the stuff they’ve copied off the competition that they forced into it.
Hate they're calling them sign ups and comparing them to actual organic growth of other apps. This is basically a new tab in Instagram being treated as a whole new app. There's hardly a sign up process because you're likely already signed up.
Hard to imagine suck/meta being the lesser of two evils
"After trying it out, it’s decidedly *not* a Twitter killer (yet.) It’s instagram with extra steps. I think the people who signed up looking to move away from Twitter specifically will stop using it quickly if changes aren’t made soon. No chronological or follow only feed is a huge impediment to how most people want to use it. It’s just a random pool of brand and influencer content. It’s way too close in function to Instagram to be a Twitter replacement at the moment."
I’m not sure if this is going to be a true Twitter alternative.First hurdle to cross is getting it released worldwide. But currently they aren’t allowed to do so in the EU due to how Threads handles data and data collection. (Which is a huge red flag)
The human race is indeed fucked
RemindMe! 6 months
It really is amazing to me just how quickly and how much musk has single-handedly destroyed Twitter. If I were on the board in any of his other businesses I would be trying to coup him as soon as possible.
"I have such a hard time believing so many people are willingly getting *yet another* social media app. Social media has such a shitty reputation these days, how could anyone want to do it again or more?"
Can we get it to be more like Twitter though? I hate looking at all these dumb random accounts that I'm not following. It's pretty much useless to me
"I don’t see why anybody who dislikes Elon and twitter would prefer Zuckerberg and threads. I think Mark is generally more competent at avoiding bad press but he isn’t really that different to Elon as far as policy.Zuckerberg and Elon are both relatively against censorship and having to police content on their site for “bad opinions”.It seems like the majority of criticism of twitter is based on them not taking down posts with a right wing perspective. I doubt Mark Zuckerberg is any more eager to pursue those policies.The previous twitter leadership was much more traditional big corp, Pepsi, Disney, style with jumping on social bandwagons and taking  down things that the government doesn’t like (such as incorrect Covid info, some correct Covid info, and anything related to hunter biden true or false). That just isn’t Zuckerberg approach to social media and never has been. He goes based on what users like and engagement.I’m sure this will be successful, it might even be a better platform, but if you want a heavily controlled experience where you aren’t exposed to ideas that you dislike this probably isn’t it.Maybe the CEO not blasting stuff out there before thinking it through is enough to make people switch. Otherwise it really is just a Twitter clone that failed previously and is working now because many people have a personal dislike of Elon and Zuckerberg is good at staying out of the limelight."
"Musk is the Twitter killer, help not needed"
Let’s see numbers in three months.  Right now it’s all about name capture and buzz
One of these guys got his platform banned from RUSSIA and the other has had at least 4 calls With the RUSSIAN president in secret. Which app are you choosing.
i am i the only one who doesnt give a fuck about any of this crap?
"Read the terms of service. The level of personal data they are demanding is insane. This includes personal health information. Also, you can’t cancel threads without cancelling your IG account."
Not sure what is funnier. The mess that Elon made of Twitter or the people fleeing to a company that handles information w/o regard.
"Lol it’s a wild world when I’m supporting Zuckerberg.  Good lord musk, you gotta try to be distasteful for that to happen.  Good work!"
"No way would I ever join the zuck, is everyone forgetting the bullshit he pulled with Meta/Facebook? why are people so quick to trust that snake now?"
[removed]
How many bots?
How many of those are bots though?
Twitter is done as a viable financial entity. The banks will almost certainly repossess it at some point. Hopefully Musk will gain a little humility from this experience
And everyone gave away all their personal data to the usual suspects once again. What’s new?
And he recovers after the meta mess up.
Why would anyone support Zuckerberg or elon?!
"Dude made a massive opening for a new business daddy to step in and right ship, could’ve only happened if Elon was completely incompetent and too busy getting high off his own increasingly radicalized farts."
I’m enjoying this but also threads just looks like IG to me
You all realize you don't have to choose one or the other... right? The world doesn't need to know what you had for lunch.
"Also, CNN finally said the word ""fediverse"" on the air.  Like idgaf about Threads personally, I'm not going to use the app, but the absolute fuckton of content that's gonna be flooding into my Mastodon feed is going to be a massive breath of fresh air."
Are you guys using it? I haven’t bothered..
Is it 70 million sign up or they fake created 70 million accounts to claim they have that many sign ups. Who can trust these companies now. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if these were fake.
"I'm always struck how tech companies never have to advertise cause whatever they do is ""news""."
We can just pick neither and it would probably help everyone's mental health
Lamer vs. Lamer
"It’s not that great, buts way better than Twitter."
Can someone make a Reddit killer ? This place sucks now.
i will keep on using twitter
Aren't those just Instagram accounts though
And Threads collects every possible piece of info about you and your web habits. Check that  out. You may not want v to sign up.
Now make a Reddit.
This post is literally how i found out about what threats is lol
"I like the UI but it felt very fake, like it only exist to show me ads"
Am I the only one that has never been on that bird site? :D
The number will never go down not because people won't immediately stop using it but because they can't delete their accounts.
"Threads is getting so many users because people don't really want to leave Twitter. They just want Elon to fuck off.That said, unless they change Threads so I don't see randoms I don't follow on my feed, I can't see myself sticking with it. It's like the only option being the 'For You' tab on Twitter, except Threads doesn't know what I like yet and for some reason thinks I want to know about football."
It‘s even worse
Already added to my hosts file to direct to nowhere. Same as Elon's disaster. Fuck them both.
Why woukd anyone run from one of zuck's or two of his censoring and problematic social medias to another he has created .
All the liberals jumped ship. Just another site that will shadow ban people eventually.
"Twitter was not that special.  I am surprised it took this long for something to take it out.Meta should have acquired it like it did Instagram, meetup, etc."
I'm starting to believe people just want to suffer at the hands of Meta
"People are fucking morons, they whine and complain about Meta invading their privacy and 70 million morons rush to give them more data in 2 days."
It's this even true? I haven't ran into anyone who actually likes threads yet
Does not allow porn; will not succeed
"You see, it’s not about Zuck winning. It’s about Musky loosing."
"Who wants to go back under the Zuck's censorship regime? Not me, that's for sure."
"Seeing as it's integrated with Instagram, do they also count every active Instagram account into this?"
"I’d avoid this personally, but the advertisers won’t. The Facebook machine is evil but predictable. Elon is out of his depth and unstable, and clearly hasn’t got a plan for the crumbling network he’s randomly throwing poorly executed ideas onto while defaulting on payments owed left right and center. And of course actively rate limiting eyeballs because he drove out all his competent engineers for being … woke? Who knows. Ads are gone on the back of this. iI’ll just be musk and his mob left soon. He’s fucked."
Was it a design choice to make it look like shit? :/
Threads is a trap. Meta wants your biometrics. Nope.
Nooooo! Whyyyyyyy! Is there seriously not another option but fucking facebook? Gooddamnit
"Wow, its like given an alternative that isnt full racist bullshit, with the worst ones shoved into your feed whether you want them or not, and capricious decisions on alleged ""free speech,"" people will jump on it."
70m is a lot of bots.
"Twitter is effectively on the way out, threads could be approaching Twitters user count in a few months at this rate."
[removed]
"Why are people signing up? Twitter stinks, Meta collects all your info. What’s the rush to a new social media platform? Let it die."
Zuck in 2020/2016 lection the literal devil.Now the savior because he's not Elon.It's funny watching middle class give their opinions on and argue for their favorite billionaire. Y'all are a literal peanut gallery watching kangaroo court proceedings.
Is it likely those 70 million might be bots?
A bit bullshit. That's 70m is because people just clicked yes on insta. A lot of those 70m haven't even opened the app
What do you think is the percentage of bots there?
Bots sign up pretty quick.
"Ah yes, let's switch from one cancer to another."
I've read it's buggy and fails to present relevant content. Pass.
Elon threatening legal action helped threads far more than anything Zuck & Co could have dreamed of
The real test will be how many of these accounts are abandoned once Blue Sky is out of beta and lets everyone sign up
"Musk has no one to blame but himself.  He won't of course, but the entire planet knows."
"While I am happy there is a true alternative to Twitter now, I'm bummed that it's a Meta service.I'm still hoping Bluesky is what everyone moves to when it opens. I'm not giving my data to Meta yet again."
It's actually the final nail in Truth Social's coffin.Wonder who Devin Nunes will try to sue this time.
Are we all supposed to believe they aren't 99% bots just like Twitter?
"I hate Zuck and Meta, but not as much as I hate Elon.  I whole heartedly support the Threads just because I hope it destrpys Twitter.   I love the fact that if the Nazis switch over the actual existing content moderation on Threads will stop alot of their crap."
Why use either?
Are y'all out of your mind?!
Why would you use that shit? Thankfully its not legal in Europe.
All 70mil are AI
Still worse than Twitter
"I don’t understand why after every shitshow Meta(Facebook) has been apart of. They would willingly sign up and give their data to them. It’s almost impossible to not give someone your data, but at least you can try to control who that someone is…"
"\~3B FB users...70M sign-ups is a conversion rate of 2.3%...not that good even for only 48 hours. Of course, the headline needs to be clickbait so you get the large number upfront because people are stupid and can't think for themselves."
The logo looks like a pubic hair.
So far I don't like it. There is no way to view news or search by a subject. It's just Instagram comments. It's not killing Twitter anytime soon
Isn't Threads automatically created account for you if you have Instagram?
Imagine thinking you either have one or the other..
Didn't a lot of people leave fb because of how invasive it was? Why would they go back to one of his projects where it's almost definitely going to be the same?
Here's an idea.1) Delete Twitter.  It's a cesspool and has always been a cesspool.  It was a cesspool long before Musk bought it.2) Don't support a different cesspool social network owned by a different scumball billionaire.  It's really not that difficult.
"60m of those are bots I bet, just like twitter..."
"Nobody is using threads besides liberals who got bullied off Twitter because the company no longer gives them a special blue checkmark and speech they don't like (not illegal, mind you, they just don't like it) is no longer removed. I look forward to the lawsuit."
"i can't search by hashtag and see trending items and stuff similiar to twitter, or maybe i'm just not understanding how to see that type of content."
"from what I understand the problem is that if you dont like the app, in order to uninstall it you also have to uninstall you Instagram app too.Has this been verified?  Sounds like a sleazy Zuck move."
"The funny thing is Musk probably thinks he has the upper hand here, but I’m sure Metas well payed lawyers scrubbed this entire new platform before releasing it.Elon is doing what he’s best at creating theater and his right wing circle jerkers will rightfully join him on that hill"
"If you rook for teh Zuck, Elon did do some serious shit."
And once twitters a rotting shell built out of a neo-nazi echo chamber and everyone uses threads the Zuck will fuck all the users.All of them.Dry.
Threads is still a cheap copycat of Twitter.  It has nowhere near the same capabilities as Twitter yet.  Honestly we will see in a year where they are.  Unless they roll out a lot of new features I see a lot of people reverting back to Twitter.
Vomit..None of you should be joining shit until those two fight it out like they said
Is this for real? How much of this are bots?
"I signed up. So for no porn bots, actual content moderation, no endless ads for dodgy Chinese knockoff shit, no right wing nutters sprouting their hate speech. You know what, it’s alright.Also anything which causes that man child musk to cry is always a good thing."
Threads is currently terrible. You can't control your experience at all. Have fun if you hate Elon Musk that much.
Who the fuck is signing up for Threads? Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
"Why are people signing up to Thread, the app collects all of user phone data?"
Yes please let one company own everything. Amazing idea
"Oohhh. They could have 70,000,001 but I refuse to join them. Bwahahaha"
"Pleasantly impressed with Threads so far, will definitely incorporate it into our business output. We haven't tweeted for a year now and don't intend on going back."
"Threads is great, and go’s to show people appreciate content moderation. I like that what I read has been fact-checked by experts and no conspiracy theory’s or MAGA garbage has made it past."
That’s a lot of bots
Piece of shit along with the left wing surrporting Zuck.
"What exactly is wrong with Twitter anyway?  I honestly don't get why people are so mad.  There has been some weird glitches and decisions that were not that smart, but it's not any worse than Facebook. Facebook is actually worse. They often make changes that make the site near unusable and just have to get used to it.  I never seen people get so mad about that.  I also wonder what these numbers are based on, are they automatically signing up people who already have a FB account?  If it was not for the news talking about it I wouldn't even know Threads exists."
"69,999,999 bots and Zuck's mom."
Why the hell are we talking about this
"Oh look, more paid shill free advertisements from Meta!"
But where are the blue checks and rate-limited feeds? This is not nearly the dumpster fire my phone has come to expect from installed apps!
"I don't care about Facebook or Insta, but at least their CEO isn't out there stirring up hate. Suck it Elon, I hope threads eat your entire lunch."
The main reason people love it: no right wing hatred on it.    Yet……
"It's boring at the moment. Because there's no curation to the feed I'm reading shit from people I don't care about. As soon as you get to see the people you follow, I'll be over there 100% and sacking Twitter off completely."
"Also, 70m sign-ups while the release in the EU is still blocked. One of the large markets this app cannot access yet and it still got so much response."
"Let’s see how well it performs in the coming months and years. Even with the changes on Twitter, it’s still a household name for pornstars, politicians, black Twitter, etc."
"Threads doesn't allow pr0n, not interested."
"Google+ hit 200 million, this won't be convincing me to buy back any of the Meta stock I sold. Social media app launches are by far one of the most overhyped and frequently manipulated things in all of silicon valley culture.Consider the case of millions of redditors saying they were going to leave for another platform because of the API changes (never happened) or the great voat exodus (never happened) or if you're really old the slashdot wars (reddit is now many times larger than it was when everyone said they would never use it again) or the time everyone was going to leave Facebook for VK.Most people don't want to give up an account with 50k followers for an account with 8 followers, so they'll keep their Twitter accounts. Eventually if Threads fails to get any meaningful engagement, they'll stop logging in.I'll wait until the dust settles to declare the age of Twitter is over."
They should change its name to TK or Twiki ( short for Twitter Killer )
As it should! 1 billon users by next month
"That's a lot of sign ups. On its face it sounds impressive. But how many of those users were already Instagram users? That is the metric that I would like to know. I think ""new"" users would be a better benchmark to discern how Threads is affecting the social media landscape."
"Once all lefties leave bird for threads, gab social can emigrate to birdie. XDHive minds maintained."
"So, Elon is an openly fascist piece of shit, but Zuck is gonna mine and sell the fuck out of your private data. Why are people playing into this?"
Uh the app sucks. No hashtag searching suucks.
I tried threads for a bit. The biggest problem is it's algorithmic feed. I don't want to see cringe brand posts and vine has-beens on my feed. IG users are just too positive there to attract any real posters.   It's just not fun without the unhinged posts you see on twitter.
I mean we know they mod it better. My thread isn’t going to be up there with some racist nazi shit
Google says no app for Android yet. Will that happen soon?
I don’t have any of that social media.  I almost want to get threads.  Only because Elon has become such a conspiracy spreading dumb troll.  Never thought the Zuck would be so appealing to me.
"edited.....the corniness of the internet and meta in general will never stop amazing me. I read today that the only way to delete ""threads"" is to delete your FB and IG accounts. We know that people are too mentally weak to do such a thing so it actually just paints them into a corner. sad."
"I think we’re actually looking at the best case scenario for a post Twitter internet. Some users go to BlueSky, some go to Threads, other go to one of the many clones that are popping up. It’s decentralized, and we get something closer to the days of forums."
Bots bots bots
Oh GOODY!!! I get to choose from Biden or Trump for my online social interactions!! Why the fuck is it always down to 2 shit choices in America. Where's the diversity? I'm fucking tired of monopolies
"However much musk is controversial, he can't hold a candle to Zuck.Musk runs two great companies:which made cars sustainable, which made space exploration cheap and sustainable. He calls a Thai guy a pedo, does a few megalomaniacal stuff, buys a social media platform and ruins it.Zuck runs an empire of social media which is intent in doing countless harm. Don't say Insta is positive or Facebook.. The only good thing Zuck has done is not ruin WhatsApp."
"Does anyone have experience with it, is it as fun as Twitter?"
Let's see the retention
Launched in 100 countries…not in the EU because we don’t tolerate tying apps together here. You’re free to launch a standalone version Zuck’ 😜 but that won’t get you all the data you want to make money of.
Terrible title!!Dont call it “zuckerbergs”! There are thousands of others who made it happen.
"I'm pretty sure most of those people just accidentally got there by Instagram and don't know ""Threads"" exists."
"Ever since that almost cage match it’s been downhill lmao. I’ve already heard people shitting all over its privacy policy, which apparently makes fb look nice, so I can see this being a dud. I hope. I hope it all burns.No shit, I wonder how many ‘new users’ are just bots and troll farms."
I can’t wait to see how this feud plays out between Musk and Zuckerberg.
"This is the internet basicaly saying "" the enemy of my enemy is my friend. """
The lizard face should make one for reddit
I think it will be super easy for advertisers. I’m sure meta already connects Instagram and Facebook together. Threads will just be another option for advertisers to click easily
"Reality imitate arts, as if a mesh of Silicon Valley meets Succession"
“We are definitely focusing on kindness and making this a friendly place.”How tho?
"Well, I guess if the big zuck says that."
take my data.. everyone already has it
How many of those sign ups are bots?
I signed up. It's a piece of crap. I won't be using it.
Just trading one evil for another.
I can't wait to post about my Threads experience on twitter.
I think this is really fucking stupid.
…we’re enabling billionaires’ pissing contest why?
Couldnt think of anything worse. Another social media app that people will complain about while actively complaining how shit it is.
It’s still not a full twitter competitor. It is missing basic features like “trending” and a “discovery” page
should have named it the Octagon
Now someone do Reddit
"Threads is like it is just eating up most of the Twitter users and....now no one wants to use none of them, lol."
It’ll peak then drop off a cliff
65 Million of them are Facebook Bots.
"Talk about jumping from a frying pan to a fireMeta sensors everything, including Palestinians, like there is no tomorrow"
Unavailable in EU because of privacy laws right? Sure to be a bit of a sticky point
"Out of the frying pan, and into the fire. 🙄Fuck."
"Unless it gets a following-only feed soon, it’s done for"
Facebooks version of Reddit when
Sure. Wink wink
Those were log-ins people made with their IG accounts according to Threads community notes.
I'd rather my neighbourhood was full of people screaming their self-masturbatory narcissm to each other into plastic cups on string than giving themselves as fodder to fucking meta.
not even close to the same as twitter. the meta world and the twitter world dont mix and never have
"It all seems weird, a few weeks ago there were news about Musk and Zuckerberg fighting in a boxing match, Elon makes continuously horrible decisions for Twitter and now comes a new platform from Meta that is similar to Twitter. I feel like this is to further monopolize the internet."
I've been waiting forever for my bluesky beta invite. But I'm not going to another facebook app.
"Even with his mommy protecting him, Musk still gets k.o.'d by Zucchini man."
Guess we're all in for a wild ride then!
RemindMe! 6 months
Only because everyone is talking about it. I'm sure there were other alternatives that the media could have pushed than one that will benefit fucking Meta.
I have never used twitter (32m) and lifes good man.
I legit have no clue why people just flock to the new shiny thing...when it's identical to all the other things...like no one even knows what it is but fuck gotta sign up!
Twitter is completely over
The fact that so many people still sign up for this stuff after all the fiesta Meta have made concerns me more than anything about twitter.People just don’t give a fuck anymore.
And to think that it looked like Twitter had successfully killed threads just 2 years ago
Facebook had the crack down and all the lawsuits for privacy. Won’t personally be exposing myself further by having another Zuck managed account
Imagine how many it could have been if they complied with EU law
Smdh if people are still feeding into this crap they deserve to get shit on
Is this new joins or just existing meta product users clicking joij threads
It's one thing to get 70m sign-ups - it's another thing as to how many are sucked in through other Zuck apps - and still another as to how many stay active.  Final number is yet to be seen but anything Zuck does should be suspect at this point.
"That's nice, dear. I hope those people have fun."
mobile only. lol
But how many people are using it?
"Did we really need more of this crap? Yay, another useless media app."
This isn’t the cage match I was promised but I’ll take it
Kind of waiting to see if Bluesky takes off when I can get an invite.
Of all the things to clone they chose Twitter? It wasn’t even profitable before Musk lit the dumpster fire.
What does “70” sign up mean here?
"I tried it, it sucks. I only want to see posts from people I follow. I don't really care about sports and my feed is filled with sports accounts for some reason, and unrelated threads from topics different from my IG follows. No way to currently adjust preferences.I think I'm done with social media algos."
"Wtf , so Elon just bought Twitter without a contract saying, ""hey zuck, you can't make a similar app (aka Twitter)after 5 years "" or so?"
Daily active users is all that matters
Zuck laughing all the way to the back as Elon reeeee s and rages
"To delete threads account, you have to delete instagram… whose to say the numbers aren’t inflated?"
Oooh ZuckDo Reddit next
Are those actually real sign ups or is Zuck just using Instagram / Facebook accounts to automatically add people to Threads?
There's a non-musk twitter? Sign me up!
Oh no! All the bots on Twitter are moving to Threads!
"Sorry euros, your not invited :)"
"I wonder if Elon's likely loses $44B, will he realise that his premise, about Twitter, was wrong?"
"Everyone needs something to make their lives feel meaningful…religion, charity, an illustrious career, perhaps the arms of a loved one. Glad this cosmic struggle between  people you’ve never met over a website does this for you guys"
"Twitter went the dumpster fire way like Reddit. However let's see, time will tell how ""threads"" unravel on this one !"
Twitter users blaming Elon for it being such a nasty place. LOL.
"There's just 2 things I'm currently wondering about:1. The chances of Threads actually being a success when it's not available in the EU.2. What marker regulators would do if Threads becomes a success. Meta is already a social media/communication juggernaut due to them owning Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. If Threads becomes hugely popular it's not too crazy to think that regulators will start looking into this."
*Mouth breather sees notification pop up on instagram/facebook to set up new account**Mouth breather clicks link*News: 70m sign-ups in two days!
"10M+ on Google Play, so the rest are from Apple????? Sus."
"I decided a while ago, I'm not switching from Twitter. It's not good, I just don't care enough to change. I'll let my account die"
My timeline on Threads is the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen.
"I really don't understand why people take such issue with threads. It's nothing new. It's just a part of instagram.  Taking issue with instagram? Okay yeah sure, I agree with that, but threads? please"
What is Threads? I first heard about it yesterday and now I’m seeing references everywhere.
I was actually surprised to see Threads plan on the road map to become a part of the fediverse.That. Would be a game changer
"Well no shit, it's pulling from his existing instagram userbase. The site will never be popular with the crowd that uses Twitter: rapid information and news. It's more of a pop-culture thing, like if instagram comments had their own website."
threads sucks for artists who wanna draw smut
"Are people joining Threads or are they just fleeing Twitter?I know it's just semantics, but I won't get over the idea of how spectacularly Elon Musk destroyed one of the world's most powerful tech companies in less than a year."
Zuckerberg vs. Musk. Disney vs. DeSantis. It’s taken some truly massive pieces of shit to make me root for Zuck and Disney.
I dont care for either. Let them fight.
To threads you say
It's a shame that people are using this shit over Mastadon
"OK Zuck, do Reddit next!"
My friends and I have been threading all day.
"If I can't watch porn on threads, no sign up"
Why would you jump from one shit platform to another shit platform?
"I thought Twitter was the Twitter killer. There is no industry to ""disrupt"" here"
Unfortunately this is just going to be divisive between the right and left. People will just go to their own echo chamber. Just another brick in the wall.
"I don’t even understand the point of “threads”..it’s an Instagram add on to talk to people from Instagram, that I can already talk to on Instagram?I’m confused."
Has anyone seen a news story with a quote linked to Threads?
"I don’t understand how anyone would run towards zuck and hand over your privacy, plus the potential of constant censorship. I stay on reddit because the ready of the platforms are fuckin ridiculous, this is just another one."
"Idk if I'll ever use it, but I'll sign up just because it's not Musk's."
"So where is the webclient? Apparantly not on [threads.com](https://threads.com), which would make sense."
Rare Zuck W
"Literally don't give a shit about Twitter, just signing up to expedite the burn."
Oo? How’s his Metaverse doin?
Just hit 90M
"Well, this begs the question: will users prefer the Meta product where they trade data and privacy information (users are the product) or pay for Twitter where the service is the product, (though also supported by ads but not to the invasiveness of Meta)"
"It would put the nail in Twitters coffin if the main feed consisted of ONLY the accounts you follow and their likes, comments and shares. Constantly showing me things I have zero interest in is NOT the move…"
I can't seem to get it to sign up on mobile. Just want to register my username at least.
Elon is coping hard with this one 😂
How many of those are Twitter bots?
70 Million in two days !  Looks like the bots are at least on board for Zucks new platform.
"I love that Twitter is dying, but I don’t think I like that Facebook is taking over another corner of the internet"
Timing is everything !
Truth Social be damned!!
how many of the 70M are bots?
"Waiting for him to pull a Trump and go ""Zuck should thank me for how Thread become popular."" Like you just know it's coming when the lawsuit doesn't come through."
I don't have Twitter and won't be getting Threads but I am enjoying watching Elon get some comeuppance.
"Alright, where is the Reddit killer? I want to join that too."
I wish there was a trending page. I use Twitter to see what’s happening at a glance. As soon as that goes to threads I’m gone from Twitter.
"Is this not for iPhone? Sorry, I have iPhone and don’t know if I don’t know any better."
Let them fight.
How many employees does Meta have.
Zuck officially has a monopoly on the social media game
Both are turds.
Well because people have hard FOMO
When will thr Zuck create a Reddit clone I just want my RedditIsFun app back the official reddit app is terrible 😭
Did we all just collectively forget how much we hate Meta?
Crazy. Facebook is pretty much going to own 100% of active social media
"Fucking Elon, making me root for FB"
"I’m not one of them thankfully, I don’t need a replacement. I just want dumb people to stop doing dumb shit."
Its just you and me reddit! 💪
Please don’t let Threads be a thing. I hate Zuck almost as much as I hate Elon
"""They trust me. Dumb f@$k!"" - ZuckFool me twice..."
"If you save $10,000 a day, it will take you 27yrs to save $1 Billion. Elon paid $44Billion for Twitter."
Just don’t trust him at all
When they add features it’ll be superior.  Right now it’s just good to not have to weed through right wing bullshit to talk to people. Hopefully they continue it.  Twitter can keep the nuts.
Twitter isn't going anywhere. It's reddit that's burning. Nice try tho.
Anything that makes Elon whine makes me smile.
Feels like I was trapped by Meta.
I fucking hate [the sweaty five-head lizard] but I've got to admit it's glorious to see Elon Musk's utter humiliation.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend?
It will be a ghost town in a few weeks. It’s literally just twitter and people haven’t not mass used twitter for years because of Elon. They don’t understand the point of it and it’s going to get real old posting status updates into the void
"Let’s be real. People will still use both, but eventually twitter will be old hat. The people want fresh not good."
I’m hearing they are already censoring/demonetizing content. SMH
Oh god if it’s anything like Facebook it will be dead in no time. Facebook is trash anymore
Umm its all bots loke twittet
"hey Reddit — remember when you were pro working-class, and not pro oligarchic partisanship at the behest of anyone who thinks differently than you?"
Threads is half baked.  Missing too many features for anything outside of curiosity or staking a claim to a handle. Will check it out again in six months when it's hopefully done.
I believe this may be the very public “Cage Match” Elon was asking for
I cant believe I am rooting for Zuck.
Wasn’t Facebook around before Twitter?Wasn’t being on Facebook the attraction of being able post/blog about something and people could like it and also comment about the aforementioned post?Isn’t Facebook a more established internet social medium than Twitter?Hasn’t Elon been losing credibility by shooting his mouth off since claiming to make a “ Joke offer” to buy Twitter and being held legally to his word?
Threads don't allow NSFW content of any kind tells me everything I need to know about it.  Pass
I don’t understand why the logo looks like an a tho…
Why do people want more social media lol
It’s not rooting for Zuck. It’s rooting for Activity Pub protocol.  Threads in the Fediverse is huge.
Thank you Elon & Zuck
Well… the “Twitter killer” doesn’t have nsfw so I’d give it a few weeks until it’s just an unenjoyable version of instagram/facebook
"And just like Twitter pre-elon days, most will be bots."
"If Meta is being serious about making it easy to migrate your followers to other instances in the fediverse, I wonder how quickly their userbase will shrink as soon as they open up federation?"
"Probably all those people who are on twitter because the have to be on twitter (celebs, politicians, museums, etc), and who are also the same on insta and fb etc.It's really, really shit though because what we desperately need is for people to move across to the fediverse and just let centralised, commercial social media where users are the product to die. It's objectively harmful to humanity.Meta hardly has a good track record when it comes to vicious and insidious manipulation of people. The business model is completely immoral and indefensible."
"I could sign up too, if Instagram would send me the code to verify my number"
Did anyone else sign up just to poke a fragile ego?
“Twitter Slain”
Threads sucks. At least on Twitter I can see posts from people I follow only and not be beholden to an algorithm to give me random shit. You can thank Elon for that change.
"people celebrating like its gonna win. im not so sure, for starters you need an app to view anything, you can't see posts from desktop this is gonna be a huge drain, also i don't think many people want their profile with their actual friends connected to a twitter like account. further how is this any different from a short facebook post i can't tell the difference between them. And most importantly Porn. twitter has it and meta doesn't. This app wont kill twitter its cause its not even competing in all the areas."
"Tried it, nothing really special. At least I can find topics and interesting people on Twitter. Threads sucks."
I don’t have instagram so I guess threads is not for me
Guys I am still waiting for everyone on mastodont
Anyone remember Google+? It’s a matter of time before Threads is forgotten.
Guess we're stuck in a world where rooting for Zuck is the lesser evil! 😅
"It might get good reviews in the beginning, but once subscribers reaches pivotal point, we'll be drowned with ads like everywhere else."
"This is a modern day d\*ck fight between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk! Twitter is like a sick dying horse, and Mark wants to put it out of its misery it seems!"
It’s funny how many will dance with the devil 😂
I just cannot stand zuckerberg… I don’t care what he steals… I mean creates
Used it yesterday. Being able to follow everyone from Instagram makes it easy to get started. Also being able to seamlessly access someone’s IG profile from their threads profile is cool because now you can easily see what this person looks like. Not everyone posted photos on Twitter.
"Absolutely hate to say this, but its Zuck’s best move since they bought Instagram. He absolutely nailed the timing of this launch with all the Twitter BS."
"Twitter rocks. Bizarre how blatant censorship, cance culture and misinformation is mistaken by the youth as virtue. Bizarre…"
"1000%. If Twitter was functioning business as usual, they would have been mocked online for being a Twitter clone. Now that Twitter is burning alive, they are being praised for filling the void. Sometimes your value is determined by the current environment and not the originality of the idea."
"[It already had](https://tcrn.ch/3kO3vdf), actually.Threads is not entirely new, it was just shelved because it didn't stick. Now that Twitter is a sh\*tshow, Zuck has taken it out of its shelf and repurposed it. It's actually impeccable timing, I'll give him that."
"Elon buying Twitter is the only reason this exists, Zuck started development after the purchase went through, and this couldn’t have worked out better for him since Elon is an idiot"
I don't know if it'll succeed without a website... It's just an app.
"Yeah it would be more like Reels, which is trying to compete with tiktok but the problem is people who use tiktok aren’t really looking for an alternative."
"i wonder if it actually would've failed. it's not like threads would've had a shortage of users or and the loud voices on the internet complaining about it wouldn't really do much unless it got a reputation for being ""uncool"" or something.I don't know if it's your intention or not, but you can't really criticize threads for being successful only because of Elon when if Elon hadn't happened they probably wouldn't have made the app in the first place."
"The timing of it makes me believe the Elon-Twitter saga is the only reason they're even trying. If they started working on this right when that whole fiasco started it would be right around 9 months from initially greenlighting the idea to launch, which sounds about right for a company that already owns multiple social media brands. I'm sure tons of the source code is directly copied from Instagram."
"Imo, the shitstorm at twitter is what caused Zuck to develop and release threads. He saw a gap in the market which was people wanting the old twitter back, so he made it."
"Twitter pre-Elon would wipe the floor with any social network trying to overtake it, Elon made it so shitty people actually root for ZUCC the famous lizard guy used to be mocked everywhere. Imagine being such a loser like Elon to get here lol."
Threads was probably a mothballed project from years ago that they decided to fire up again as soon as Twitter's fortunes started to change. At this rate they're going to show up and eat Twitter's lunch.
I’m not sure. Instagram is way bigger than Twitter and Threads is basically linked to everyone’s instagram account. Threads would’ve been a worthy competitor even if Elon didn’t fuck everything up.
Failed ? No. But definitely less successful.
Wtf?
">weirdoThat always strikes me as such an undeservedly cute, innocuous word to describe him."
I can't figure out how to get threads to only show who I follow though. It's got lots of random bullshit in the feed.
"I think it will anyway.  The hype will die down, and people will find out it's just Facebook with a Twitter clone bolted on."
"I'll go as far as saying it probably wouldn't have happened if Elon hadn't torpedoed Twitter to the point that people were BEGGING for an alternative that Mark had all the resources to provide...because Elon went and fired most of the people that made Twitter work, lol."
"It is objectively a bad app. But all Elon had to do was buy Twitter and change nothing, and Threads would have died day one. It’s only good because Elon’s bullshit (and Jack Dorsey keeping BlueSky invite only far longer than it needed to be) made Threads attractive by default. It’s like the social media version of the 2020 election. We didn’t vote Joe Biden because we like Joe Biden, we voted Joe Biden because we hate Trump."
Timing is everything.  So is preparation.
They still will .. u guys will see twitter was always garbage so will these
It wouldn’t exist. That’s why they made it. They wouldn’t have tried otherwise. Looks like they stood the app up in like 2 months. It’s completely bare bones. Not a planned release a year ago I’mSure
I don't think so. Many Instagrammers / Facebookers don't use Twitter at all. I think the vast majority hops onto Threads from their own services. The only number I would be interested in is how many hop from Twitter to Threads for good.
"At least he’s not censoring everything, which is also a weirdo move"
"The internet has added  ‘timing, timing, timing’ to the success of business since ‘location, location, location’ doesn’t always cover it anymore."
"They would've never even tried this if Elon wasn't fucking up the user experience on Twitter so much, Meta has said as much.They basically saw what Elon was doing and realized there was a huge amount of existing twitter users that would now be happy to jump ship if there was a viable candiate to take over from twitter.Even the launch itself was forced to be even earlier than planned because Elon was once again fucking up even harder than before with his rate limits, and Meta saw an opportunity to grasp the zeitgeist and get disgruntled users to jump over."
Harder and faster than zucks meta-worse.
Not us that line in politics and see why our country is where it’s at
You dont have to root for anyone here.
Threads isn't a twitter killer. Twitter is committing slow motion suicide and Threads gives us a place to get our dopamine fix.
It’s Kang vs Kodos.  Don’t vote for either.
He's losing a $44B bet.  It's so wonderfully glorious.
"First Disney, now Zuckerberg. Are we even allowed to hate capitalism anymore?"
Robot v racist
Some people really do have the memory of a goldfish. Rooting for Zuck?! Fucking hell
"> few are worse than forcing me to root for Zuck.Fuck that noise. This is pulling our head out of one noose just to joyfully stick it in another. Zuckerberg is just as much of an evil technocrat fuckface, he just manages not to display it in public as much."
Worst timeline
"You don't have to root for Zuck, and quite frankly shouldn't.People shouldn't be wanting a twitter replacement, because ""replacing"" twitter is just going to lead to the same problems. It's honestly the same as reddit, discord, and even youtube.The internet was a better place when things were more segmented, and any one forum imploding due to shit moderation didn't spell the end of nearly every major community online all in one.We don't need another 1:1 centralized site that is also run by a billionaire cozy with fascists who literally utilized and utilizes his platform to help fascists spread their propaganda, and who wanted FB to be THE internet. Period.And yet people flock to this shit, because no one wants to admit that maybe at least to some degree what twitter had is actually unsustainable and flying too close to the sun in a manner of speaking. Shit, there's a lot of that in our society and economy right now and people don't really want to admit it because they don't want to give anything up - even if maintaining some of these status quos is actively harmful to society, and the planet itself."
I’m not rooting for Zuckerberg. Anything that gives him a second life after Facebook is its own disaster.
"Zuck is a robot/reptile, but he seems like he does good sometimes. Mush is a has been savant who spouts hate speech and is probably a pedo if his projections are anything to go off."
"Zuckerberg may not be a good person, but he’s a much better person than Elon if we’re comparing. He started a company to try to cure all diseases (which is a bit ambitious but when you have a trillion dollars I guess you can do anything). Elon is overall a trash human"
I feel like I felt when I voted for Biden
Why not? Mark seems to be about responsible philanthropy. He and his wife are great members of my city and fund our municipal hospital that caters to the poor. He seems to be more like Gates then Baumer. Elon came to my city and used our talent and expertise to build a car company and then move it to Texas to avoid taxes (that funded the culture that could create such a successful car company) and talks shit about us everyday. I’m behind Mark. I think he’s a good man and a great business leader and he is getting/fighting his shareholders to put billions into VR gaming which is something I’m passionate about. Fuck Elon
Zuckerberg is an American hero.
"I'm under the opinion of letting them eat each other. I am happy because a billionaire is sad. If the roles were reversed, I'd still be happy, because both Zuck and Muskrat are shitheads."
"The fact you're taking a side at all is more of an indictment on you than either of these billionaire douchebags, tbh"
"Yea, allow one man to rule all of social media."
Wtf?
"This feels like a dirty ""root"" like the Disney/DeSantis thing.What has become of our society.We're all just running on spite at this point."
This timeline gets more bizarre
Root for the guy who just built another product with the sole purpose of appropriating your personal information?That's what your win is ?
Any original opinions here ?
I bet it's not as much of a coincidence as it looks like
I ain’t rooting for either of em.
It's wild how quickly folks have forgotten about Cambridge Analytica
"I’m only glad Threads exists so that the content creators that I like who use twitter can have an alternative. Some of them were begrudgingly holding on for dear life simply even though twitter needs to die simply because they have sunken costs and it would kill them to have to start over.If threads is a good competitor, we can finally be done with that shitty app"
Threads is censored trash
"> [...] said SIO’s research manager Renée DiResta on Thursday.“If Threads keeps up a positive tone, it will be a big draw for advertisers – particularly because Twitter has developed a reputation for being a vitriolic arena where factions gather to dunk on their enemies.”i mean i hate the zuck, but this might just work. and elon is, to keep up with the vitriol, already threatening to sue."
"Thing is, Threads doesn’t need the advertisers to follow. If Meta gains knowledge about its users that allows it to better target ads on Facebook and Instagram, they can monetize that. And their pockets are incredibly deep. Ads will come to threads, for sure, but Meta doesn’t have to win the advertisers over from Twitter, just the users. Ads come only after they’ve won."
"Most of the ads left on Twitter (apart from a few big brands) look like they came off an assembly line. It's always a name like ""MostShop"", with some abstract, multicolored geometric logo, selling some goofy little toy or gadget. It's probably all the same company using an automated name/logo generator to evade mutes and blocks."
"The advertisers are already there. My wife constantly buys stuff from Facebook, it's how she found Moink Box and our CSA."
"Twitter has been bleeding ad revenue since Elmo took over and started turning it into 4Chan, but ThreadLimitGate might turn what was a persistent wound into a severed artery."
"I mean, it's going to be bigger than Twitter in a week."
Another thing no one mentions is that influencers will follow because all of their followers get transitioned if they're on threads.
Threads was also really easy to sign up for. It took like two clicks. There will be two real tells of the success. Current active users and the advertisers.
"Ol' Elmo better hope he gets the Trump treatment from the courts (ie: immediate hearimgs and such), because even if he wins, which, I don't think he will, it'll be like trying to revive a rotting corpse."
"Twitter has only ever had two profitable years. We need to all remember that the reason Twitter was for sale is because it had no future with all ad revenues across all the internet in the tank.Yeah, Musk is driving Twitter into the ground in unique ways but it was more or less doomed as a business.Meta has a big warchest so they won't be hurting real soon but their profitability has taken a nosedive as well and there's no reason to think Threads is going to provide net gains.Still interesting to watch I guess. Will advertisers move t Threads. What advertising dollars there are, possibly. But the pie to too small these days."
the advertisers were the first ones on it. threads exists solely to scoop up marketing money that musk chased off twitter
"It’ll probably be as easy as checking a box for any advertisers already on meta platforms. As a marketer (anecdotally), I see little value in Twitter today — Threads is compelling not because of the platform or format, but because of the early adopter community and tone of conversation… let’s see how it evolves."
Big pharma doesn’t wanna run ads on twitter anymore? Oh nooooooooo
10 million bots did…
"I’m assuming Threads will still collect and sell user metadata to advertisers, but at this point, I dunno if advertisers will need to buy from yet another social media application.Advertisers will probably want to run ads on Threads."
"I already left Facebook and I'm not going back. Fuck all these social media sites so hard. They don't empower global communication, they hold it hostage. It's so frustrating. This society sucks."
"Advertisers is the biggest thing. If Threads continues to grow and Elon continues to be unpredictable, companies may start advertising there instead which would essentially be the death of Twitter."
"If users are on threads, why wouldnt the advertisers come?"
"> More importantly will the advertisers follow.     I think they will, but as some people are already discussing, that might be a problem for Threads.    &nbsp;  ALL the brands have already jumped on Threads, and they're active. There's a chance it ends up being a vast wasteland of brands talking at each other, with little interaction from normal people.    &nbsp;  Right now, nobody really knows. We'll have to see."
"Yes, through meta ada, any fb and insta advertiser can advertise also on threads with a couple clicks. Same for oculus in the future. Personally i think Meta will become an ad player as big as google."
"Twitter is turning into something Truth Social, full of crazy right wing people spamming comments with their blue checkmarks."
It’s become diet Truth Social
"Meta knows how to monetize for ads already, I’m sure they will do fine. Twitter who knows, Elon actively reduced moderation, which makes it less attractive to some companies as an ad platform."
Richest man in the world can't even pay his rent on time.
Must be the greatest businessman.
"> ...a piece of doo doo, that he has run into the ground.That's where doo doo belongs. It fertilizes the soil and helps crops. All hail farmer Musk!"
Imagine the help he could have given with 44 billion instead of the ego trip he did. Billionaires need to get persecuted. All that money sitting in their accounts doing jack shit to a struggling economy should be illegal.
"It's insane, I can't believe this guy is a billionaire. He looks so stupid, every day reading his posts and the way he writes it seems like some random brainwashed right-winger."
My question is... what information on Twitter is so damning that he has destroyed the company just to bury it. Nothing else about this effort makes any sense.
Playing devils advocate here but this was pocket change for him. Spending this much money on an app because he could just shows how much power he actually has. Terrifying stuff
"It has a larger user base, and more user hours than ever before. What are you talking about?"
And you jerk off into sock.Do cool.
Can’t wait for him to sell it off for 4B in 2 years
">for a piece of doo doo,Twitter was actually an interesting platform with a huge lead over anyone else in the space.Musk turned it into doo doo based on every awful decision he made"
Who paid?
one for the history books
"That is 44,000 millions."
"In this battle, I'm rooting for the fighting to hurt them both."
So shit in mouth disease.
[deleted]
"I like Musk generally, but I've only seen him make bad decisions regarding Twitter."
[removed]
I’m the spy!
"I want that too, but it's sobering to realize that even if Elon's wealth doesn't increase another dollar, he's got almost two hundred years worth of interest payments because of his Tesla stock.And as it stands right now, I think that stock earns him another year's worth of interest payments every month or so. dude is actually pissing billions away for the lolz"
"Same here, my feed is full of some girl boss influencers either my friends or I don’t follow on threads or insta. With how shockingly accurate and specific my Instagram search/recommended section is I’m baffled none of that has transitioned over. Like it knows I’m a very gay man into dogs and drag queens but I’m getting…. ESPN and sports ? Did my profile get mixed up with some bro? I only check once a day now because I have to sort through so much slop to find who I follow."
I like how one person here actually tried to use it instead of just jumps to the part of lecturing Musk on Reddit opinions 101
"An empty feed is the fastest way to drive away potential users. Why would users come back if there was nothing to see, especially in the first few days?"
They do really need a “following” feed so I only see who I’m following
It's 1 week old. They've already said they're releasing on a follow only feed.
"I like it but I still miss how fluid the twitter app felt, and I miss being able to save images. The other problem is that things I liked to follow on twitter aren’t on threads"
"This is done on purpose so you follow as many people as possible before they introduce ""Following"" tab."
"I've used it for a while and it isn't too bad, you really need to find the niche you're interested in and find that (or be that) community member that makes the post to gather a bunch of people to follow.You can tell the dopamine machine is only partially there, my feed is slowly converting to mainly things I'm interested in, I still get random noise from other areas but I don't mind that at all really."
Yeah that was my first gripe but they'll probably change it when it gains traction.I've noticed anything new from all the people you follow appears at the top of the feed and then there's a small grey line that precedes all the crap from people you don't know.I really hope they introduce tagging too since you can't search by topic at the moment!
"Sounds like Facebook on the rare occasion I ever open it. Literally scroll through wondering why each post is being shown to me, since I have no idea who the fuck any of them are."
Yeah I don't like it so far
They need to reach a critical user mass before they can do that.  They don't want people leaving because of empty feeds.  I wonder how close they are to that.
What a braindead take. They want people to discover in a new appGo touch grass
That's how I felt about Twitter way back when. It's kinda how r/popular works too.
Still better than all the right wing lunatics. That’s all I was getting on Twitter before I deleted it.
I don't use either threads or Twitter but isn't that just like youtube? You get a main page with whatever the algorithm thinks you should see but you can subscribe to people?
"Breaking: Meta announces new social media platform “Subs”, where users can create communities, create posts within them and reply underneath with a nested commenting structure, using “uplikes” and “downlikes” to surface quality content."
Lemmy needs to optimize quickly
"Meta won’t compete with Reddit thought, they’re vehemently anti nsfw content. The deviants will keep Reddit alive"
"IMO even worse than the API mess and the Musk fanboi comments is that Reddit was in a prime position to make a bid for the twittersphere and didn't even try. The reddit personal page (you know, the one no one uses) is a pretty good facsimile of Twitter and could have been promoted and refined. But nope... the window of opportunity was grabbed by Meta not reddit. It's a bad look to investors."
"Same, Reddit used to be one of my most visited and almost only visited network, now I spend less and less time here, it needs to change or go back to its roots."
Move to Lemmy now. Fuck Reddit
"I mean, you’re still here and posting. All of us who are posting are part of the problem. I don’t get us."
> a user base that are begging for somewhere else to go> Can't wait to see this happen to RedditI think you're vastly overestimating how many people actually cared about the API thing.
"Problem you’ve got here is, not as many people as you think actually give a fuck about third party apps."
"Reddit is not going anywhere. Much in the same way Facebook is not going anywhere. Your only choice will be to just abandon Reddit, which will continue to garner more users."
try discuit.net maybe?
The last thing we need is for even more social media to be controlled by one company. What the hell are people thinking? This is insane.
Only Lord Zuck can save up from the evil Twitter man.
"That is how low Elon has fallen, few years ago everyone loved him, literally he was that lovable down to earth millionaire now he is just some crazy manchild brainwashed right winger."
That’s because a Twitter alternative is something people actually want. Nobody really wants a Metaverse
Competition is healthy
They made it extremely easy to create a Threads account from Instagram so yes majority of the signups are from Instagram. Almost one-click experience. We will need to see how this cannibalize Instagram’s usage. Signups number alone doesn’t tell the whole picture
"> 70M signups could just as well be all meta/instagram users.That's what I wonder, did they just auto sign up a group of existing users from their platforms?  Because outside of news articles talking about it I have never even heard of Threads. I don't see anything within Facebook even indicating that it exists.   I wouldn't even know how to get to it without googling it.  So how did 70M people run into it by accident?"
"It is all Instagram users. You have to have an IG account. So it's more like 70m people installed the app and logged in to their existing account. Still impressive, but hard to compare to organic growth of a new competitor as others are doing."
"of course it is, the metaverse was/is never supposed to be less than 10 years away. of course a social media network that exists _now_ is more popular"
We sure as hell don't need more social media to be controlled by one company.
"They have indeed been heavily pushing the app on instagram while neglecting to mention that you need to delete your instagram account to delete your threads account. As a result, the sign ups don’t mean that much, and there will be a lot of dead accounts."
"I mean, he was right."
He's not wrong.We always thought there were lots of stupid people in the world.  It took Zuck to show us how profoundly we underestimated how many of them there are.
"Replace ""Zuck"" with literally any company that gets any of your data / info.None of them give a shit."
"I really don’t see the point of this copy paste. That was then and this is now. People change. Or not, but either way it’s not very relevant."
This is why I hate giving me info out at all.
That's a good trade isn't it?
"I hate Musk the most, but Zuck is not really lesser evil. He sold our democracy for cheap, sold countries to military dictators, helped genocides happen easier, sells our lives for even cheaper. Fuck them both."
"Can't even say if Zuck is lesser evil, but I want to get the hell out of Twitter is there's a decent alternative"
META a lesser evil? I think not! Doesn't get more evil than META
"If you're calling Threads a lesser evil, we are truly fcked"
I’ll take it
"*Evil is Evil. Lesser, greater, middling… Makes no difference. The degree is arbitary. The definition’s blurred. If I’m to choose between one evil and another… I’d rather not choose at all*"
Not a lesser evil. Another threat to democracy.
> lesserCitation needed
Lmao we support Mark now?
[removed]
In what universe do you like where the Zuck platforms are less evil? Have you not seen a single piece of news from the last five years 🤦
[deleted]
FB?  FFS.  Twitter is still better
That's all of human history.  Well the positive parts anyways.
And they say that American Politics and American Businesses are nothing alike or related.
Points to Ragnarok
"Lesser? Not quite how of put it.  But maybe getting rid of one evil, leaving the other."
Lesser? Or equivalent?
There's always a spit roast!
Lesser?
Just like everything else in life.....
As someone who found Twitter’s user base to be insufferable and anything Mark touches to be a data privacy nightmare can someone explain to me why Threads is better? People are just happy to see more moderation?
"lol, seems like Reddit really is delusional."
At least it’s an evil I know
You dont have to choose. People are just addicted to evil. The good thing to do was to choose to not use these apps.
Is it a lesser evil though? Because from what I saw it is collecting more information from users than twitter.
"People being curious about it is a good sign they’re a viable competitor to Twitter though. Mastodon didn’t have 70 million signups, so you don’t see Elon complaining about them, but you do see him complaining about Threads."
Signs ups are literally the hardest part of anything internet related.
Isn’t it linked to their instagram account? As in they just login through that?
I left after one day lol
"I opened it once, saw the sorting was all algorithm driven from people I don't follow and not in chronological order and promptly left. It's not at all the same as Twitter and I can't see it scratching the same itch."
Engagement is reportedly way higher than Twitter. But not sure if that lasts.
"After a couple days I am pretty much done with it. For me, my page is just filled with “copy paste” meme accounts and influencers. I follow hundreds of my actual friends and see literally none of the posts until I search them and see that they actually have been posting.. it’s the same reason I deleted my instagram app. I don’t see my friends posts, just a bunch of random ass suggested posts that I have zero interest in."
But the sign ups are creating the hype.
!remindme 2 years
From what I've seen moderation/TOS is also pretty strict so for better or worse this will discourage a good number of twitter crowd.
Facebook / Instagram / Tiktok don't allow porn and they're all pretty successful
I hope never does! Disgusting person
What percentage of people on the Internet consume porn on Twitter or Reddit?? It’s used only for promo purposes.
All of them. My people are the best people.
What did he say to you after you signed up?
"Why do these Elon musk haters make it so your life revolves around him? People hate him so much they comment in every thread, I just don’t get it. Signing up to a social media site to ‘piss off’ a billionaire is not the behaviour of a normal person"
"He doesn't know you exist and you're basing your day to day decisions on him, sounds like you've already lost."
"You just gave up your health data, financial data and browser history. The permission requests are insane."
"> I’ve been trying to find a decent Twitter alternative mainly for news and every option sucks.yeah after a cursory search, I can't find most of the journalists I want to follow on here, so I likely won't be using it until they decide to switch as well."
"Gotta say, as a longtime Twitter user, that does not feel true. Threads feels like Twitter without the weirdos, though the weirdos do make Twitter a fun place to be."
Why?
[removed]
"I don't think one can fully replace the other, seeing as Twitter has a website and Threads doesn't."
My social media platform is still better than yours.
People hang out on linked in?
Most people don’t want a feed full of dullards with paid for blue check marks filling up their feed.     The undermining of the blue check was a massive blunder imho.
i think people want to just keep up with shit they’re interested in without seeing a bunch of weirdos engaging in culture wars non stop
[deleted]
"What do you mean by ""sanitized"", and forcing them to be nice? Like, allowing people to be racist and spread misinformation, but like actually call them out on it? It's basically just a less cash-strapped pre-Elon Twitter. It's there to make money, not become a pay-to-play partisan echo chamber like Twitter is"
"Yeah, exactly why I'm not switching to Threads. I'm only on Twitter to follow NSFW artists who moved when Tumblr got rid of porn. Threads isn't allowing NSFW content so what's the point of even signing up?"
This is just bullshit. You're part of the problem if you think things can't be interesting unless people are being mean to each other.
"I'd much rather hang out in a place that doesn't spread misinformation about ongoing disasters, racism, homophobia, etc."
"Ya. I want social media so I can argue about nerd shit and occasionally post a thought, that while not *bad* doesn't match the professional image I try to maintain. I can't get that from Facebook, or Threads, or any Meta app"
"A lot of apps let you sign up using Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc accounts. I don't see how this is different."
"yeah I want it to be a twitter killer but it's no good, it is basically instagram in a twitter skin right now, the best aspect of twitter is trending / live news / reactions to things, you can't search properly, can't click on any hashtags, no chronological feed, no follow only feed... it's got nothing that makes twitter great other than a lot of the people signing up"
[removed]
"Idk what you mean, it functions essentially the same as Twitter.I don’t know if it will kill Twitter or not, but it certainly IS Twitter."
"It's not a red flag per se. Companies need to build processes and features to handle EU privacy and deletion requests. Threads was probably rushed out to launch in the US to take advantage of Twitter's latest drama before they finished all the due diligence you have to do on the EU side. Look at the inability to delete your Threads account right now; that's a non-starter in the EU.Regardless, when the EU version launches it's not as if any of their data or privacy policies will apply to people outside the EU."
Also to make it available on desktop.
How so?
Both Twitter and Meta apps (excluding WhatsApp) are banned/blocked in Russia. Source: am Russian.
Neither!! Believe it or not that’s an option you guys. Age of social media is dying. Let it.
"We really are just picking which oligarch to be enserfed to these days.  Are you paying homage to the China-Meta-DNC-Disney-Pepsi Imperium or to the Russia-Xcorp-RNC-Newscorp-Chick-fil-a  Confederacy?  Choose renegade or paragon option, get red or blue ending."
/r/notliketheothergirls
Watch the social dilemma on Netflix. People are are extremely addicted social media and they’re only working on ways to make it more so. I wouldn’t be surprised if eventually they’re required to put warning labels on the signup pages just like we do for cigarettes.
Then why even bother commenting? It's a post about two large social media moguls and the health of their respective platforms. Why engage in something that isn't relevant to you when you clearly don't care about the topic?
"I tried for a while, but most of the content on the home page is from people and businesses I do not care about at all, how the fuck people like this?"
"You cared enough to comment.  If you didn't care, you wouldn't have even clicked on the comments."
Have you read the terms of service for every other social media site? I might have some bad news for you...
I believe they came out and said yesterday that that is not true. I saw a thread on it via Reddit. Not trying to fuck with you. Just saying I think that was false info being pushed around.
was thinking the same. Apparently so long as it pisses off Elon... anything goes.So long as launches like thois do so well.... the Zuck and others will continue to exploit data etc and get cheekier each time they do it.I am honestly shocked at how such a reviled person and company can get such a surge when launching a new platform. Do people not look into ownership etc of these sites... or is it case of the *politics of the moment*
"If social media sites are the only thing you see, I highly recommend putting your phone down and going outside to touch some grass."
That was my first thought too
Fucking exactly. Remember the time we watched Trumps Twitter bot follows rise to some stupid unreal bullshit number? Then Twitter killed a bunch of bots and his followers went down by millions. LOL. Same shit here. You know they’re going to be trying to do something.
"Probably not too many. Instagram has over 2 billion users, ~~are~~ with more than 100 million just in the US.If just one out of 20 Instagram users outside of the EU tried threads, that would be 70 million users."
"Using it, it feels very nice. Good to have no nsfw content and political things."
"Sure, doesn’t every free online service collect data? That’s my assumption at least 🤷🏽‍♂️"
Couldn't.Anti-competitive actions( they would have been screwed by congress and probably forwarding motions to split up Meta too).Look at Microsoft/ Activision deal
There is not much appetite for burning money. Twitter was never profitable.
"Whining is a Reddit thing, not a real world thing. Reddit amplifies opinions, but is still a small minority. If people actually gave a shit about privacy TikTok wouldn't exist and Meta would have a for sale sign on the corporate office."
It's been publicly available for two days. How many people have you actively been trying to talk to about it in that time?
">It's this even true? I haven't ran into anyone who actually likes threads yetYou sound like one of those ""I just ate so no one else must be starving"" kind of person.  Jesus, people are stupid."
"I like it. Less pay to play, less bots, and less Nazis. Not for everyone, and very niche in that way."
Haha.  Millions of people like it.
">Who wants to go back under the Zuck's censorship regime? Not me, that's for sure.Then stay on Twitter or truth social or whatever you prefer.  It really is that simple.  That's the beauty of competition and having choices."
"I mean, i'm not american so our expectations might differ. That beeing said i really don't wanna be on a platform where literal Nazis tell me who they gonna kill when the next genocide starts. But hey you do you"
"Here’s my cold hard liberal truthZuck regime >>>>>> musk regimeNothing and I mean nothing is more cringe than Musk pandering to the right wing. From US right wing fringe to Italy’s right wing; and everywhere in between. Musk, ever since his kid came out as trans or whatever happened, has been hell bent on being a right wing ideologue and always try’s to cringefully play it off that he’s treating both sides fairly.His town square was pathetic."
[removed]
"If by ""censorship regime"" you mean not letting racism, misogyny, nazism and disinformation run rampant or even encourage it, which is what Elmo is doing over at Twitter, then I'll gladly take it."
"You have to go make a threads account, its not automatic"
No. Instagram have 2 billion monthly active users.
I’m pretty sure that is happening
"I’m still waiting for screenshots to appear somewhere so I can see what it looks like, so I’ll take your word for it that it looks like shit. I’m never signing up for it myself.However, given that the logo is a pubic hair, chances are high that it was intentional."
Just like Twitter and Reddit and every other social media app that's how they make money.
A couple clients my company represents for SEO and web development are already getting their Threads accounts off the ground.  One had already left Twitter a while ago because the C-Suite there thinks Elon is a shithead.  In a month I'd bet good money almost every company we can name off the top of our head will have a Thread.
"Friendly reminder that Reddit has the *exact same business model as Meta*, and even tries to [exploit your browser](https://iter.ca/post/reddit-whiteops/) when collecting data on you (something even Meta doesn't do.)"
Because Twitter stinks as you said.
"A lot of people loved what Twitter used to be and are eager for an alternative.  There hasn't been a viable competitor until now, and the majority of people do not give a fuck about Zuckerberg and Meta holding a massive monopoly over social media.I don't disagree with you, but that's just how it is."
"I'd be willing to bet that the people who are joining threads are doing so because they don't like Elon, not because they like Zuckerberg."
>I've read it's buggy and fails to present relevant content. Pass.Here's a thought.  How about trying it and see for yourself instead of being a sheep and just believing everything you're told.
Exactly.  Thread’s heavily favors influencers and sticks the rest of us in a Facebook like social circle.
"Blue Sky won't have a built in user base, not be as easy to integrate into everyone's user flow and won't have as much hype behind its launch. So nah Blue Sky got dumped on too, along with Mastodon it's pretty much dead in the water. We forget how Instagram obliterated Snapchat purely because of ease of use and user base."
By using your brain.Who'd be fucking stupid to waste compute and bandwidth for 69.999 Million bots on a platform with no users.
He posted on Reddit.
I use pen and paper.
Ok man we get it you’re an Edgelord lol
"It's kind of hypocritical to accuse people of not caring about their own privacy, when you've posted 9 years of your own data on Reddit for everyone to see. Reddit sells your data *just like Facebook*, but your comments are also completely public, and I can infer everything from your interests to your age just by looking at your profile. And unlike other social media, Reddit tries to [exploit your browser](https://iter.ca/post/reddit-whiteops/) when collecting data on you.So much for privacy, eh?"
"It’s not really relevant how many FB users decide they want to use a Twitter replacement, most of those people weren’t using Twitter. Twitter had just over 100 million monthly active users in 2010. In 2022 they had 450 million. 70 million is a much more significant number if you use those as a comparison. What’s really important is who those 70 million accounts are. If they are are business and news organizations that people will want to follow that’s more important than getting 70 million drunk uncles that want to yell at clouds. We don’t have that information yet."
"That don’t do it for you, you can _only_ sign up right now if you already have an IG account. And there are a lot of people with IG accounts.Edit: there are 1.49 billion register IG account."
Because it's less bad than twitter.
"Twitter doesn't own the concept of online communication. Even if it's found to be an ownable concept at all, there's prior art for that."
"Tbh I opened a Threads account today after being gone from Twitter for 4 years and it was like a reunion seeing all the personalities I hadn’t seen in so long. I’m liking it so far, at least I don’t get that instant anxiety that reading Twitter was giving me."
"By ""delete threads"" means deleting the account, not the app btw"
Just let it all burn
You can’t search hashtags yet which is what I liked to do on Twitter so the feed is just populated with instagram influencers I don’t care about but they say they are working on it
"If you use Twitter to follow specific people, like celebrities or just let the algorithm recommend you random stuff, then it's a fine replacement. If you use Twitter to browse news or specific trends, then not yet."
"It's ""70m"". 70 million."
"This was my first take after getting the new app too.  Twitter breaks news stories faster than the news. A lot of places in fact use Twitter to share facts and updates.I don't actually tweet that much. I just check breaking news.When I got threads, it was just like instagram with text and pictires, instead of just pictures. There's no where to see news updates or what's trending.  It's just an algorithm of showing you content from creators.  Like,  I don't care."
As expected in our corporate internet in current year. Investors hate porn after all
If history has taught us anything then its that people like shit and people *LOVE* new shit.
You think Reddit is protecting your privacy? That's cute.
Bots have a lot of free time to try new things.
"But what if I don't want to stay on the Twitter, huh? You ever think of that?"
It's intentional. Right now they're encouraging people to follow the people they want them to follow--THEN they'll introduce the promised follow-only feed. Facebook can do all the vibe-setting they want--in the meantime I'll just wait until I can follow all my former Twitter follows (who've basically all migrated to Threads) from Kbin once they federate.
Twitter. FTFY.
"Yup. Twitter was basically a bulletin board with instant information. You could follow your city, politicians, news, sports and get updates in real time in one place. Add in direct access to celebrities, athletes, comedians, it was a unique space in social media. It obviously wasn't perfect but it was legitimized.   Elon made it so toxic that everyone was rooting for a replacement. Elon made threads possible."
"Seriously. As a car person, I see this constantly. Suddenly car buyers are raving over physical buttons, compact trucks, and offroad SUVs. None of those ideas are original, but the market has been so saturated with CUVs, full-sized trucks, and giant ipad center consoles, that buyers want some older trends back desperately."
That's literally Zucks entire fucking career.
Kinda like MySpace
"""Sometimes your value is determined by the current environment and not the originality of the idea."" -Zuckerberg family motto"
If only something similar would happen to Reddit…
I mean...this is the fundamental basis of capitalism. Existing product goes to shit; new product comes in to replace it.The issue arises when corporations start doing under the table BS to keep their failing businesses afloat. Just like what Elon is planning to do by suing Meta.
Hopefully this happens with reddit.
Powerful words.
"Great timing. I just got banned for Twitter, something I worked hard to achieve since Musk took over."
> was functioning business as usualExcept losing millions a month.
He's taking away my precious Tweetdeck and I could not be more annoyed.
Makes me wonder if meta was sitting on threads for a while but saw no reason to complete bring it to market until Elon is speed running Twitter destruction
I literally only joined threads to do my tiny bit to shove it up Musk's arse hard and fast without lube.
I wonder if Google would come out with Google++😂
that old Threads is a completely different product. they just reused the name
Except no one should be using metas products at all
Lol it was such a failure i had not even heard about it
OH I KNEW I WASNT TRIPPING
"Download are one thing but the number of daily active users is what will make or break it. I just don’t see it as a Twitter killer, not yet at least."
The Verge interviewed the product director for Threads this week and they came right out and said they saw the issues Twitter had last weekend with capping views and restricted unverified accounts and decided now was the time to launch. They crunched over the holiday weekend in order to launch some form of it this week
"Wrong, threads had already existed before and failed. Now was just a good moment to give it another shot."
A app you can't leave without nuking your Instagram account. It is almost like they rushed to make a product and inflate the number of users.
To be a Twitter killer yes but iirc Instagram got big when it was only an app.
It would have. Why would anyone go to threads when Twitter existed? What's the advantage? People don't go to a place because of how cool it is or how advanced the tech is. They go there because they like it.      Elon made Twitter so unlikable that people were desperate for a replacement.
"Apparently, it already failed. Threads isnt anything new. It was already a thing that didnt stick and Zuck just through on another coat of polish and tossed it back out."
"Nobody went to Google+ by leaving facebook, even when google had smooth integration with your personal profile."
"I don't want Zuck to win, I want Musk to lose."
"I think someone made a pretty good point earlier, that no one wants to hear the political opinions of yoga pants influencers. So here’s the secret of threads: 1. anyone with an Instagram can seamlessly sign up for a threads account2. You can’t delete your threads account unless you delete your Instagram account3. Anyone who installs the app effectively rapes their own privacySo Zuck gives a masterclass in monopoly, and shows the easiest way to defraud investors based on common subscriber valuation metrics."
So when do we get our fix for the slow motion suicide of Reddit?
"Couldn't it have been Mastodon or something, instead of another Zuck show?"
All I want is to read NBA reporter news. Woj and Shams have to get into me system somehow.
You know keep up with daily dopamine dose😂
"It's trash. Like being forced to use the ""for you"" version of Twitter permanently. Nobody likes that.Just let me see posts only from those whom I follow and in chronological order. How fucking hard is that?"
I think realistically people will tire of threads quickly but not  return to Twitter. It’s a win win!
Exactly! It's more timing than anything. Only time will tell if it truly dethrones Twitter as it's just trading one platform for another.
When will they do Reddit next I wonder
Tbh Mastodon is serving just fine for my dopamine fix
"Nothing about Twitter's death is slow motion.For a platform that has been at the top 3 for this long, dying in 2 or 3 years is impressively quick."
"There is a zero percent chance Im signing up to give zuck my data again. Fuck off, meta."
This is just capitalism in motion. Somebody takes something successful and runs it into the ground the need it fills is swiftly replaced by a competitor.Whether the user-base would be better off considering that need altogether is another matter.
"This feels like me right now. I hate the Reddit App, have been using Apollo forever, but here I am, scrolling this garbage app because of my love for Reddit/my dopamine"
"Kang and Kodos from The Simpsons are named after two characters from the original 1960s Star Trek, one of of whom (Kang) was a kind of fun enemy of Kirk’s who comes back in 90s Trek as a hero with a ton of pathos and who is totally chill with his friend being trans, and the other of whom (Kodos the Executioner) is a straight up genocidal maniac."
"And all the interest on it. Plus all the saudi money along with it. I love all of it. Hope threads succeeds enough to kill twitter, and then goes down with zuck too."
The dudes net worth has gone up by like 100 billion dollars so far this year so I'm sure he's not crying too bad.
"Hate to tell you this, he’s still a billionaire."
"He could lose every cent of it, twice over, and still be the second richest person on earth"
Exactly. No point comparing them to see who is less evil. Zuck is still terrible and shouldnt be rooted for for the shit he has done. If the Twitter is shit I will just stop using it instead of jumping to another platform run by evil corporate lizard
ya it's been crazy seeing people actually cheer on Zuck and celebrate going to Threads... like wat? the same ppl who hate elon for being a billionaire and the shit he's done now love zuck and are happily going off to his platform
Its a check. If zuck fucks around ppl are going to musk. Having an alternative keeps even the powerful ppl in check.
I want Putin to fail but I'm not rooting for Pooh.
Zuckerberg is an American Hero.
Oh he did show it a little. They even made a movie about him. Everyone should watch Social Network as it at least shows some of his assholness
"I prefer my evil billionaires incompetent. That's why I'm rooting for Musk in this. I mean sort of. I'm not exactly crying over losing Twitter, if it really is as lost as people paint it out."
"Ok, but normal people want Twitter from a few years ago.  Nobody provides that. Mastodon is dogshit. Bluesky decided to slow roll some bullshit.    &nbsp;  This is the closest thing and the people using it already had Instagram (Meta) accounts."
"He's not even a savant though. He's a spoiled, rich baby who was lucky enough to start off with enough money to just buy up companies that had products made by people with actual talent that were already viable."
"are you suggesting that randomly calling people you dont know online a pedo, like elon did, probably makes him a pedo?"
"Elon's companies have overall done less harm, but he is a terrible human. Tesla and Space X are useful. Zuck's platforms have manipulated elections, allowed the organizing of Jan 6th, and produced an epidemic of teen depression. A pox on both these houses."
Hill dog 🙋‍♂️
"Nice try Mark.All kidding aside, I do actually appreciate what he’s done for VR and he legitimately does appear to try and be a good dad/husband. I have many issues with how he has handled FB in the past (which is a massive understatement), but I’m certainly willing to give him a little leeway, especially over this current, attentionwhorish, conspiracy theory version of Elon."
"Thread is attractive to advertisers because its part of the meta universe. Advertisers will get more value because they can follow the same users between fb, insta, whatsspp, and now thread."
>  already threatening to sue.Will twitter even live long enough to see the end of that lawsuit?
Wasn’t that what Facebook became?  Just a feedback loop of rage bait to increase active users?  I don’t see how this will be any different
">factions gather to dunk on their enemies.Pre-Musk Twitter was like that too. There was a *huge* bregading problem, especially with black Twitter."
But won't those same factions fear they are losing their virtue signaling and culture war clout and just move over to threads to continue being douchbags and start calling for Zuck to cancel the people already there whose opinions they despise?
"And by ""factions"" you mean ""Nazis"""
"I don't know why people expect socal media to change the internet (its users).We can pretend that this is just a problem of platforms or face the reality.Also its funny to think Threads will be more attractive to advertisers, a platform that can't even launch in the EU due to data protection issues."
So what exactly do you want to be discussed on threads?? Do you want a ad friendly platform or a platforms where ideas can be discussed??
"The question is will users follow?  An 70 million signups is big, but I mean will the actual activity follow.  Google+ had a ton of sign ups too.  One thing that seems to be true is that users and advertisers want different things.  Most people seem to prefer the wild west Reddit of 10 years ago over the sanitized advertiser friendly version today.  Now there is a direct choice.  Will be interesting to see how it plays out."
All of social media pretty much becomes a vitriolic arena. Twitter was that way before elon. A lot of reddit has been that way for a while too
i really believe this is just the growing culture of the internet. i think most platforms slowly turn into an arena where factions gather to dunk on their enemies. many parts of reddit are just that.
"He fired the majority of his stuff and just didn’t assume they would work in the same industry afterwards?He didn’t even hold up their contracts, so any NDA they signed is likely void"
"Zuck will get the advertisers. He is a pleaser and will do whatever it takes to please themJust look at how he plays politics > I used to be Facebook lobbyist .

And drove. All the way back to Silicon Valley. I quit federal lobbying for good. I sent Mark my resignation. His only reply was a single word 'received'.

When I woke up, I re-evaluated my life. I now work at a non-profit cancer research organization, and I am now at true peace, both emotionally and mentally."
Bro I dislike zuck but he’s so much more likeable than Elon. Billionaire but doesn’t have a trophy wife. Yeah the meta verse was weird but that company is alive and trying new things. Elon seems like a weird fake person who I cannot figure out what he stands for.
Sue for what?
"Based on how many radicalized right-wing insane people have been actively complaining about their neo-Nazi and harassment messages getting blocked on Threads or their accounts getting hit with ""this is a hate account"" messages, advertisers probably feel far safer on Threads than on Twitter."
"Yep, Meta's made 5.7B in the first quarter, Twitter is still struggling to reach profitability. Meta is way way way better situated for a war of attrition."
I'm not sure how much better they can get at it.  Last I checked Meta's ARPU was staggeringly high for a free site.
"The majority of the gadgets are goofy, but all the self-defense ones are incredibly comedically illegal in many of the spots that are viewing the ads. I live in Michigan, brass knuckles actually are not legal in Michigan, and the poorly conceived dropshipping websites keep trying to sell literally illegal objects over the internet.A year ago twitters advertisers were boring regular companies, now it's just automatic name / logo generators selling illegal things over the internet lmao"
"Exactly. Twitter advertisers are already advertising on Meta platforms, probably at 20x+ amounts currently. Threads will give additional ad inventory on top of Metas fantastic ad platform which will result in more share shift of budget from places like Twitter to Meta."
The adverts on twitter have been noticeably declining. These days it's almost all adverts for garbage ebay crap and gimmick products.
At literally the worst possible time for a stumble
"Yeah, but I would not be surprised to find the Twitter is actively shrinking at the same time"
"> Twitter was for sale is because it had no future with all ad revenues across all the internet in the tank.Twitter was never technically for sale. Elmo just got high on drugs one night and made a stupid high offer with no due diligence at all and Twitter had no choice but to accept. Their board is legally obligated to act in the best interest of their shareholders, and the shareholders made out like bandits."
"I think another factor here is how much of the business is already built. The main advantage of tech is once built, theres minimal incremental cost to scale.Meta already has an ads business, so they won't have to invest more into that. Twitter would have to build these from ground up, not to mention compete with google/meta for their ad prices. Plus their ads wouldn't even be that good because they don't have as much useful data as meta/Google do"
"Meta revenues were only slightly down on the previous year and a big part of the profitability problem was all the billions invested in the meta verse.This year meta have massively reduced spending on the meta verse and culled 20% of the workforce, I think their profitability for this FY will be back to looking very healthy."
"Meta's investment in this has to be a small fraction of what they've spent trying to put pants on VR avatars: it has all the hallmarks of a skunkworks project.  If they're managing it with anything like a start-up mentality, what we've seen this week was what they considered the minimum viable product (maybe even pushed out early as the magnitude of the twitter train wreck became apparent).  If they play this smart,  they will try to fast follow with releases to clean up the obvious holes - specifically, to do what they need to to enter the European market, and (probably) to add a web browser interface to open up the laptop/desktop segment, and only then begin to add features.  Of course, there's always the possibility that they will now proceed to drown it in resources instead."
"If it kills twitter, it would close down a lot of advertising space giving Meta platforms more market share and market power to raise prices, it could make a difference."
"Meta has benefits of economies of scale. It's running Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Like what's another app on top of that? Meanwhile, Twitter is just running Twitter."
">Yeah, Musk is driving Twitter into the ground in unique ways but it was more or less doomed as a business.Twitter could have strived in the right hands. Not every business can sustain itself on ad revenue. Among the toxic wasteland Twitter also had great content and users in need of good mod tools etc. They could have build sustainable income by sensibly monetizing some stuff and maybe do something like revenue share with creators placing ads on their feeds.Instead they forced ads so hard everyone started using adblockers or alternative apps with adblock implemented and never giving users anything what users wanted. Edit button, anyone?"
Profit is down but hardly a nosedive. They pull in insane amounts of money every quarter
"Yeah, I don’t think twitter was taking up much of the market share. Threads won’t ever be a big money maker, but it could be the demise of twitter and give meta a near monopoly."
"He can, he just doesn't."
"If you’re talking about the office in Boulder, twitter had already moved out of that building.Edit: downvotes? Lol this site is so dumb sometimes. I work in an office where I could see the twitter office. I know they moved before the story came out about them not paying their rent in that location and being “evicted”."
I hear he's yuuuge.
Musk Steaks just around the corner!
Isn’t that Trump?
He’s apparently not cis so he’s probably a businesswoman or buisnessperson/s
I agree 100.  Excellent point!
The information on Twitter is all public. He’s destroyed it because he’s a moron. Tesla and SpaceX also would’ve gone bankrupt long ago if they weren’t bailed out by the government. I’m sure Elon will try and cook up some reason he thinks Twitter deserves tax payer money. If not it will go bankrupt.
That's a more productive use of an evening than whatever the fuck Elon is doing
Can't wait for the Colisseum fight.
"Yes, Facebook is famous for not having any conservatives allowed.Also, Elon’s reign has had more censorship, it’s just more arbitrary: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk"
Then again in this age Censorship is actually encouraged
"Promoting nazism and unbanning nazis, censoring shjt he doesn’t like, making it “pay to verify” which defeats the whole purpose of verification on Twitter, making tweets require login, pushing away advertisers and people away from Twitter and decreasing the valuation by a lot!"
"Even putting his politics aside, he’s done nothing but sabotage the Twitter user experience from the second he took over. He’s making a platform nobody wants to use, and he did it assuming he owned the market and nobody could challenge him. And that’s not even touching the abusive way he’s treated the company staff.> Letting Twitter not be censored is a win for everyone[Twitter is more heavily censored now than it was before he took over](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/economy/2023/5/2/twitter-fulfilling-more-government-censorship-requests-under-musk)"
Tell me you’re braindead and far removed from reality without telling me you’re braindead and far removed from reality.
Tell me you're a Nazi...
"It's justifiable for people to hate not just Elon, but people like you, too. You're not even missing the point; you're just caught in this stupid paradigm of ""fuck the liberals"" to such an obsessive degree that you're overlooking real detrimental behaviour. People shouldn't be able to push racist narriatives or call for genocide no matter who it is. The very first thing people did when Elon took over was spam the n-word over and over. That shit's not okay. If you consider all of this to be acceptable, then expect nothing less than hate and vitriol."
"The entire verification clusterfuck is one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. No, I don't want to see the Elon dickriders at the top of every comment section. No, I don't want a bunch of alt-right dipshits clogging up the trending topics. I find it completely unusable for discussion, and yes, I deleted my account. I'm enjoying the conflagration."
[removed]
"Don’t even try, you can’t rationalize anything with these people. They’ve been conditioned to exhibit outsized outrage about things, one of them (recent one) Elon. Did they give a shit about him 4 years ago? No some even rooted for him. The moment he said he was done with all the current left wing BS they started conditioning people to exhibit outrage against him. Just like they did against Zuck too in 2016/17 when they said his platform promoted Trump groups etc. But now Zuck is a “friend”. Let’s ignore the damage to the fabric of society his social networks have done and are still doing."
Here’s an award to counter the Reddit hive mind that doesn’t have an iota of comprehension to know what’s really going on other than what they see others peddling.
"This is the thing I hate about the big tech ad driven business model. They try so hard to invade all your elements of privacy, mine all of your data, pass that through basically a supercomputer and then they come up with the most I'll fitting, stupid, unrelated shit imaginable to hook you. Stuff simply doesn't work. It is advertiser bait."
"Yeah, show me the “men skipping rope with no underwear” stuff that Instagram, rightly or wrongly, thinks I want to see!"
>very gay I wonder if the amount of gayness will become a measurable unit in the near future.
There was an blue check influencer lamenting about how she had a random thought about Arby’s and how she was craving a roast beef and cheddar sandwich. It was some really blatant shilling. Having to follow people I have no interest in is a big reason to not use the app.
The fact that it creates engagement doesnt mean its not fucking dogshit.Im not a tiktok reel short zombie
"I know this is apparently beyond the attention span of most, but you could follow people so your feed is filled? Why would I want to follow random paid accounts that are simply vying for my eyeballs so that they can make money off of me?"
I remember when not every social media was about mindless scrolling and actually connecting with people you know
Have something like Reddit where I can see my subreddits or the trending page. The dream would be for us to group people
Suuuurely it will be a follow only feed. Lmfao.
I dont give a shit about any of their tactics buddy. Its obviously intended.. takes no genius to figure it out.
"Lmfao the level of projection.Imagine common sense being braindead, the follower only and discovery sections should be there day one. Thats why i havent opened the app other than for accepting follow requests from friends."
Could happen. Or Subs could sink...like...the Titani oh never mind.
We're all here. The 3rd party API is a non-issue for most. Some people have left but we're here. Do you think Meta would give free access for 3rd party apps?
"You joke.. but I can totally see them doing this.Facebook/Meta's whole MO from the very beginning is to take what's already invented, and ""do it better."" They have had tons of clones of other services throughout the years, most fail because they're obvious clones. But once in a while they're hits because of the right circumstances. If they made a Reddit clone when Reddit truly becomes unusable, it might stick."
Facebook Groups…
Doms in shambles
Does it have goblin porn tho
Upvotes and downvotes are called tops and bottoms.
so... facebook?
Just no. It is a damn certainty that the comment sorting algorithm will be so bad that it would lead to literal civil war
With slight changes Threads can work as a Reddit clone too
Announcing... Zuckit.
Take my uplike
Whatsapp Spaces?
People can’t think for themselves. This is a world of sheeps bud. I’m used to it
"Is it though? People said everyone would leave Reddit, didn't happen.I think a lot of people just read bad things about twitter and repeat them without actually experiencing it first hand.Since Elon Musk has taken over twitter my feed is more or less the same, replies have less bot accounts but my feed is pretty much unchanged. Also there have been a number of positive changes to the app (on android at least). I mean you can find content you don't like anywhere if you go searching for it, but if you don't search for it you will have a good experience.They have something like 250m users active daily, it's probably only a very small minority who want to leave. Personally my feed has a lot of people who signed up to Threads just to reserve their username and also full of complaints about how Threads in its current state is either a clone or inferior in a number of ways.If Threads is a Twitter killer it's going to take a decade and it's going to have to offer something that Twitter doesn't beyond a different owner."
Zuck does. It's like the Cybertruck that nobody except Musk wants.
It seems like the competition will soon be Truth Social vs. Twitter for the far-right conspiracy-everywhere crowd.
"Yeah, but this isn't competition. It's just a company commiting suicide and handing over its users to a company that is already in a near monopolistic state.This is going to minimize competition on the long run."
and social media isn't (including this post I'm making right now)
"It’s been a huge thing, I’ve seen it all over Reddit, tiktok, podcasts, people are talking about it."
"Indeed he was, the dumb fucks have already forgotten about Cambridge Analytica. Good thing Threads is banned in the EU, which has stronger privacy laws — just another day of being thankful I live in the EU 😌"
Exactly what I think every time I see this get reposted: where's the lie?
"The real interesting thing is knowing that he's right and the stance he takes, and how many people just flock to it anyways.Threads isn't the first twitter killer, there are far more ethical platforms that are up, but no one cares about that. They only want the big name companies like Meta to handle it, despite all the shit we know about it.I keep saying it, but the apathy of the masses is the biggest issue we face as a society. Not just in regards to social media obviously, but everything from every-day issues to government. The people have shown that the vast majority of people don't give a shit about anything. They will not riot, they will not change brands, they will not vote for the opposition. They will continue to let themselves be fucked over because it's easy that way."
This is actually something he said though
"Yes, since then he has realized that he can ask for a lot more than just emails and pictures and people will continue to just give it to him to be sold off.If you think his attitude has changed, you've not been paying attention to any of the privacy qualms that have surfaced regarding facebook and data privacy.It is still very relevant to both what he is doing currently and his attitude on the situation."
"> People change. Or not, but either way it’s not very relevant.It's relevant, he's in charge of Meta. People like Zuckerberg don't change, they merely adjust themselves to become tolerable within society."
The only reason Threads is popular is because of Elon Musk. Zuckerberg is getting good PR off of this. OP is using his quotes to emphasize that they're both evil.
"Nice try, Zuck."
People change 😂😂
"it’s like chaotic evil to neutral evil, I think it’s a lateral move. That said, I *do* fucking hate Elon Musk, so that swings it for me."
It's a good trade. The more fluid we are with trading platforms the more leverage we have. The less fluid the more leverage the platforms have.
"I mean Mastodon is right there. It takes a bit of effort to get going (you actually have to follow some people and hashtags, no algorithm is filling your feed for you), but once you’ve followed some things it’s so much better than Twitter ever was. And no ads, no data mining."
Annoying billionaire vs racist Nazi billionaire hmm
"> He sold our democracy for cheapNever happened, Cambridge Analytica was a false flag by the GOP to discredit our hero Zuckerberg. Elon was probably involved, the GOP has a history of promoting electric cars to fund their social wars.Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia."
Twitter is also still a much better application for the user.
How did Zuckerberg sold countries to military dictators? Helped genocides? what?
"I don't know if he is a good guy, but he doesn't publicly shame people on his platform he doesn't agree with every other day. An asshole who keeps their opinions to themselves is preferable to one who doesn't."
[deleted]
Try out Mastodon!
"A lesser evil to Twitter sure, but for as much shit as people talk about Twitter’s negative impact on society even pre-Musk, folks here still seem to really be rooting for its near identical replacement."
">I pity you... You claim a lesser evil doesn't exist. You're standing on a flagstone running with blood, alone and so very lonely because you can't choose, but you had to. And you'll never know, you'll never be sure, if you were right... And your reward will be a stoning, and a bad word. I pity you...It's funny that you are quoting Geralt, who ultimately had to make a choice in the very same story. Because of that choice, >!Renfri died, and he was forced out of Blaviken, never to return.!<The whole point of that story is that sometimes you have to choose. And sure, evil might be evil, but there is a difference between >!killing a bunch of bandits and a bloodthirsty princess versus letting them butcher an entire town out of her thirst for revenge!<.For anyone interested – the story is *The Lesser Evil* featured in *The Last Wish* by Andrzej Sapkowski."
Big difference between calling one a lesser evil abs actively supporting one of them. Calling one less bad is not the same as calling one good
I mean it’s far from perfect but meta does Atleast actually use verification properly and does somewhat police their content. That’s an upgrade. I mean we are arguing between two pieces of crap but I would say meta is going to run threads better than Elon will Twitter.
"Please top parroting this. Threads isn't banned in the EU. They never launched there in the first place and are currently waiting for approval from the commission. They decided to launch it without EU approval because elmo stepped on another rake with the rate limit last week so they jumped. The reason they might not get approval is because it shares a platform with another large social app (Instagram) which goes against EU regulations sharing data across platforms. Not because of what they collect (the terms are the same as Instagram). They will most likely end up splitting it off from Instagram, which would be a good thing in general imo.. I don't want to cross streams with a public app and an anonymous Twitter clone. And now you have to apologize for making me defend Zuckerberg."
did you pay for a blue check mark?
"Mastodon also seemed needlessly complicated whenever someone talked about it, so that probably slowed them down a bit"
Lol wtf let me know what their day 7 and 30 retention is. Not some honey moon bull shit period
"Not for Threads, where all it takes to sign up is to have an Instagram account. Sign ups aren't the hard part for them, giving people a reason to keep use Threads over Twitter is."
Moderation is an interesting word for censorship.
If meta reports signup numbers Elon will certainly take notice and likely cry about it like the big entitled baby he is
This isn't accurate.
The whole point of Threads is that it's normie Twitter. I dunno if it'll work though cuz normies don't like to write or read.
Twitter feels like if you went to the city and gathered up all the meth addicts and schizophrenics and asked them to debate politics in the replies.
I swear Reddit intentionally has selective memory about just how evil Facebook and Zuck are when it comes to owning Elon
I swear people who say this never used Twitter before Elon. The use experience now is down right horrid. He has destroyed the platform.
"It's by far the most awful timeline. Go get 500+ friends on there (they just accept to appear not as green), scroll through your feed and weep.You have the self-promoting success gurus, you have the ""OMG SO EXCITED TO START MY JOURNEY"" graduation posts, you have edgy opinions of tech by CEOs nobody's ever heard of that are so fucking stupid they make your eyes water, you have shameless self promotions, it's a literal dumpster fire, it's by far the worst.However I got all my jobs through responding to recruiters on LinkedIn so you can just bypass all that."
r/linkedinlunatics
"sadly, they do"
"Lol, I love that you were downvoted for this super controversial opinion"
Why are you on Reddit then? You can find all of that and then some on Reddit.
"It really does not function the same as twitter, other than the fact that they both utilize text based posts. There’s no feed of only the people you follow, there’s no chronological timeline, it doesn’t let you read posts from where you last left off (you have to scroll to the top to refresh, read down through the newly surfaced posts until you hit old stuff, then scroll back up and repeat; versus Twitter where it’s a smooth experience of just scrolling up to see the latest stuff in reverse order without losing your place.) There aren’t any hashtags or other ways to follow trending topics. Posts from the accounts you want to see are drowned out by algorithmically suggested brand and influencer content. I’m guessing you don’t use Twitter often."
"It doesn’t function the same as Twitter lol, there are no hashtags, which is the primary reason Twitter got popular!Also, no sorting posts by topic (done by hashtags), no current events or trending tab (also done by hashtags)The major similarity to Twitter is blue tick for opinions of famous people!"
[current news that I'm fixated on] surely affirms my belief that [personal irrational belief about the world]. And I have the mental gymnastics to prove it!
Now we all KNOW we can't TRUST anything a Russian tells you... Just look at Ukraine.  Remember

"There might be an incentive for meta to run threads at a loss, to keep their other services in the public eye for young people"
"Reddit is extremely leftist, who obviously don’t really care about their information."
Lol my bad homie. Didn't know I threatened your life existence by questioning if users actually like threads.
"typical reddit mentality, “I don’t see it in my echo chamber so it must not exist “"
Or hear me out... don't use either of them. Whoa. What a concept.
When you leaving reddit?
Threads isn't even available in your country.
.... you don't want a warning of immanent murders?Silencing evil doesn't eliminate evil. It just lets it sneak up on you.
"I guess ""owning the libs"" 24/7 as your only personality trait for the last several years ended up alienating some people. Weird how that works. Coupled with rate limiting, pay to play, and harboring hate speech, why exactly are you trying to shame people to be loyal to a cult of personality like Elon?   You're like a hundred comments into this thread alone defending him and Twitter, I just don't see what the motivation is. Threads might be a total flop, but it's just funny to hear people like you dying inside because of a social media preference"
"Incorrect, here is a analogy for you. Let's say we have two prisons full of people who are guilty of molesting children, one of the prisons is twitter, the other, threads. Now lets pretend the twitter prison just happens to be located right next door to another prison, full of people who punched innocent grandmothers, and threads is just a regular prison. You can bet your sweet sweet ass i am rooting for the twitter fire in the hopes it takes the grandma punchers with them to the grave. All the prisons burning down would be preferred, but we will accept losing one for the moment. Most people have no interest in visiting either prison, but boy oh boy is it fucking funny to watch Elon get absolutely shredded by his own incompetence.  Absolutely hilarious.Of all 6 billion people on the planet, you stan for one of the idiotic ones, a fine choice indeed."
The irony is this is exactly what a fascist would say to force their way onto others.
Well you’re wrong
"Hmm, I'm not aware that I agreed to biometrics tracking on Reddit. I quit Twitter the minute Elon came on yhe scene. FB is crap."
"It takes 5 seconds to create a Threads account, what do you mean “SEO and web development getting the threads account off the ground” like it’s a huge undertaking process? Lmao"
“Stop being a sheep and try the new Facebook thing”. Is this comment for real?
Haha. So determined with name calling and putting thoughts in other's heads. Try literature over social media. It could help clear what you have.
"An edgelord because I don't want to support musk or Zuckerberg? I never knew!Wait, is this your alt, Mark? You sneaky snake, you!"
"A fair analysis, except comparing 70M sign-ups to 450M DAU is not best which your drunk uncle example addresses. Ultimately my point stands that this is clickbait, and in fact, when viewed from the lens I provided 70M sign-ups is poor. Proper curation of the network will tell if this platform will be niche or successful."
I’ve got a feeling that a huge percentage of Twitter users also have Instagram accounts. So I would expect almost everyone looking for a Twitter replacement probably have IG accounts.
"You literally have no idea what you're talking about. But thank you for your opinion, I guess."
Yea good on ya with the “that’s cute”‘response. I didn’t realise I jumped in a time machine and transported back to 2012.
You go wherever you want but it seems like Threads is going to be banning the hate group members.  I’ll support any site that doesn’t allow members to try to have other members killed because of the sex partner preference or their bits.
About the local stuff. We all have cranks we need to shout down or shut out to discuss business at hand. Kind of the reason Robert's Rules of Order are a thing. With Elon at the helm that weird mouth breathing weirdo you owns too much Nazi memorabilia gets to derail discussion about where to park because T Swift comes to town. Look bro idgaf about your weird ideology and how T Swift is in the illuminati.  I just want to know where the swifties are parking so I can avoid foot and car traffic. Specific because that is what happened when I visited friends who lived near a venue. They told me to check a thread.
I just wanted a place to get up to date information about any power outages and not have to wade through Nazis.
"Ever since Elon added blue checkmarks buy option it went downhill real fast, all of the cultists and right winger Qanons are promoted in comment section, it's impossible to enjoy the app anymore, literal cesspool."
"Honestly, this might be the biggest fuck up since Nintendo spawned Sony's PlayStation."
"Eh, Twitter was always garbage. I considered making an account in like 2011 but wisely avoided doing so. Only now Elon has made it garbage squared."
Because he’s such a genius right? Right???
Maybe this Elmo guy really is a great inventor by creating opportunities for alternatives to flourish because he's so full of clown shit.
Has that actually changed though? Twitter seems to me to work exaclty as before
"I avoided twitter entirely for years because everyone told me it was a toxic cesspool. Now you're telling me that it actually had a purpose, or at least it did before Elmo set fire to the entire thing. I'm always late to the party, man."
"So in a roundabout way, Elon is Zucks butt buddy?"
The touchscreens aren’t practical and I think enough people have finally owned a car with one that there is also finally enough pushback on it. It’s more about functionality than a trend on that one.
"Look out for Meta's next new service ""Upvotes."" An online forum for all types of communities with a built in voting system!"
You're not wrong
I certainly didn’t have “be on team Zuckerberg” for my 2023 bingo card.I feel crazy for considering signing up to threads and instagram. WHAT IS GOING ON
Notepad++ would be furious!
"Oh please don't give Google any ideas. Was circles, now with spheres!Supposedly the *smartest* people work there.."
"Google cant come out with something like that thats good, their corporate culture is absolutely incapable of greenlighting any project that gives a user what they want.if they do accidentally make something people can make useful with workarounds they destroy it."
"Ugh I'll wait for Google#, with it's higher level of abstraction and ease of use."
Google+ but it’s just a Reddit clone.
"That had failed, google had Orkut first"
I will accept a MySpace+
"I think the point is still valid.  Presumably they had developed a 2.0 that was never released, but was easy to pull off the shelf when Elon started shitting the bed."
Or Twitter products for that matter
"Facebook/Meta has a tendency to copy other successful services and launch their own clones, most of which fail spectacularly unless integrated with other already successful apps like Facebook and Instagram. They had a standalone Snapchat app that failed, a standalone Tiktok app that failed, etc. They only succeeded through merging the tech with FB/IG.Threads might succeed, but only because people are looking for an alternative to Twitter. It's good timing for sure."
Do you have a link to this?
Also an app you can’t use without having an Instagram account first. I think people are just excited there’s a viable twitter alternative but time will tell who actually stays or not.
"Yeah, that bit of news means I am not going to even try Threads. i would like a Twitter replacement more streamlined than Mastodon, but it being linked with meta was off-putting enough, nevermind not being able to delete it."
And unavailability in the EU.
"Boo, I dislike your theory. But happy cake day!"
Sounds like the GoJo Deal
Instagram wasn't competing as directly as Threads is with Twitter.
I was thinking it might appeal to people who don't have twitter but have insta and those people could've moved there. But I guess if you want that sort of app you would've already been on twitter anyways.
but I thought that was a dedicated DM app and I haven't seen anything about DMs in this threads
> You can’t delete your threads account unless you delete your Instagram account> > They've announced that the ability to delete threads account without torching the IG account will be coming.
Is threads data collection that much more invasive than IG?
"in regards to point 2, they're working on that. from following the guy who made Threads and his team, they apparently threw it together in *really* short order using the Insta framework.they've got a lot of features planned and being worked on actively. they admit it's pretty barebones right now. from the tone of their posts, they genuinely didn't expect anywhere near this number of signups this quick."
Investors are making money on Meta. Its not fraud. Wtf is this ignorant reddit hive mind shit. Do you know how stocks work?
"1. Sure.2. Apparently it’s an upcoming feature. Maybe they just wanted to launch ASAP.3. Same privacy label as other products, so I doubt *most* people will care. A label doesn’t mean they’ll automatically be able to get all the information."
>Anyone who installs the app effectively rapes their own privacyBut if they already have an IG account they've already given up everything. Threads doesn't take more than IG
">shows the easiest way to defraud investors based on common subscriber valuation metrics2) is irrelevant to this for two reasons:\- they claim ""sign-ups"" not ""existing accounts"", so 70m is factual (and most people wouldn't delete their account a day after signing up, even if that was implemented)\- what investors care about and is reported for other Meta social networks every quarter are things like revenue and daily/monthly active users, deleted account or not, an inactive user is worth 0 to investors under those metrics>So Zuck gives a masterclass in monopoly,If TikTok or Snapchat or any of the other social networks that compete with the ""monopoly"" (a paradox, I know) created a twitter clone and allowed seamless account creation/follows, would that also be ""a masterclass in monopoly"" or does it only count when uncle Zuck does it? lol"
"You had me on ""rapes his privacy"" I will keep out. But then the curious me will sign on a new account with a throwaway email and account."
It’s 2023. Weird privacy hardos like you lost the war a decade ago. Move on.
> no one wants to hear the political opinions of yoga pants influencershalf of twitter was the political opinions of onlyfans influencers
"""monopoly"" lol. he just released an opt-in product that is specifically designed to compete with the world's most famous social media platform and its other competitors. entering a competition (or even winning it handily!) is not monopoly."
"> Anyone who installs the app effectively rapes their own privacyI've heard if you have multiple Facebook accounts, Meta might merge your accounts so that your real name shows up on all accounts. This is an issue for victims of stalking/harassment where people intentionally separated accounts to make themselves harder to find or reach."
"I kinda digg the no anonymity part, so it ousts even more assholes and makes people more accountable about the vitrol they post online."
"So, nothing new? Lol If you aren't on ig/fb/ meta products for those reasons, then don't sign up. Isn't it essentially designed as an extension for those ppl who already have ig?"
The only winning move is not to play.
I'm seeing the irrelevance here. What's the difference between having FB/Instagram/Whatsapp on your phone vs Threads?Your 3rd point is just over reacting
"The Twitter app has a worse privacy policy and makes more access claims than the Threads app, at least on iOS. I don't have an android to test with, but this narrative that Threads is more privacy invading than other apps is not true and actually seems kind of like a propaganda attack based on how often the claim is being promoted. (All of these apps collect our data, but Threads does not stand out here at all and I wouldn't consider it a point of comparison vs Twitter when deciding which you prefer if you're going to use either of them.)"
"> Anyone who installs the app effectively rapes their own privacyToo late, they already did that with facebook and instagram and whatsapp."
I don't feel sorry for anyone investing in zuck properties
That... is not how fraud works.
"This privacy concern,  what exactly is it that people mentionBlackmail risk, or just companies making money from a service they provide?"
">Anyone who installs the app effectively rapes their own privacyTo be fair, if you're using any kind of social media (including Reddit), your privacy is already dead and laying in ditch."
Anyone that has Instagram on their phone is already giving away their privacy. Threads doesnt make a difference for those people. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
What extra privacy hits am I taking for installing threads? I have a very inactive old insta acc. Can you be more specific about what security things are involved ( genuinely curious and cant' find anything of real note )
"Oh... Oh wow. Amazing points. Really drives home just how big this is, in the field of social media tech/apps"

move other alternative like discuit.net or lemmy
Most people are fine with Reddit the way that it is. Others left for Lemmy.
"Kbin or Lemmy, already solved"
"Mastodon is not easy to use for the average person, whereas Meta know how to make that stuff easy for the general public."
The issue with Mastodon is that it was was basically Twitter meets Discord. You had to join 'servers'. I don't recall there being any kind of global feed when I tried it at launch. That's fine and all but... I already have Discord?
Zucc has the built in user base.
No one moved to Mastodon. Like NPR isn't there. Rex Chapman tried but no one was there. George Takei moved but that's about it.
Mastodon can’t put a billion dollars into it.
"Because Mastodon sucks, and so does Lemmy. They're both weird niche decentralized social media networks that most people don't want to waste the time trying to figure out."
"Apparently they are going to eventually integrate the ActivityPub protocol, so in theory it will communicate with Mastodon and other federated apps. https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/"
lol the only place I've heard of Mastodon even mentioned is on reddit.
"lefty techbro hugbox was never going to hit it off. Techbros in general need to come to terms that making shit into linux and ""open source"" has zero market appeal to joe normal"
"The problem with Mastodon is that normies don't give a shit about open source and decentralization. The centralization of Twitter is a big part of its appeal.I think Bluesky could've been the one if it could've scaled up sooner. Yes, it's an open protocol, but they threaded the needle for normies that Mastodon couldn't by having a clear ""main"" server. There was buzz and a real demand for invites, but unless they open sign-ups for everyone real soon, it might be too late for them."
"Hopefully, threads follows through on their cross platform discussion, using activity pub as the basis and be able to see posts from mastodon and mastodon users see posts from threads… it’s supposed to be decentralized and portable which may be a great thing going forward.Also, mastodon’s implementation is terrible. I hope they can do better to have another rival"
"Not possible because the whole non-profit, federated model is at a disadvantage of competing in a free market and the world of capitalism."
"Mastodon is useless for a lot of things people use or used twitter for. Just because it's also short form, doesn't mean it does the same things."
Mastodon UX is bad enough to confuse the average non-tech user.
Mastodon is WAY too complicated for the average user.
You mean a complex and difficult to use system that will alienate anyone non-technical?
"Two things. If you go to ""Threads"", you'll see all the people you know already there. And the infrastructure to handle the traffic. All these other sites can't handle the traffic and signing up takes time. Threads is going to happen because of these two things."
"TIL that the Kang vs Kodos thing is actually from The Simpsons, and **not** Star Trek."
"It dropped $180B last year so, yeah….perspective."
Still nice to hear he basically burned tens of billions of dollars on crap
People wishing to show the middle finger to Musk and all they're doing is hugging Zuckerberg.
So instead you stay on this platform run by a *checks notes* evil corporate lizard. Got it.
I don't think anyone loves him. They just hate him less than Musk which is very understandable.
"So many fake celebs left twitter because of Elon and because he’s evil or whatever, but immediately go to Threads like Zuck isnt a terrible person? Get the fuck out of here lol."
"> I prefer my evil billionaires incompetent.You're in luck, for whatever reason it turns out a lot of them are greater imbeciles than we give them credit for. Personally I think the whole thing is making a mountain out of a molehill but we shall see."
All I’m saying is he was friends with Epstein and likes to talk about everyone being pedos all the time
That’s true. Overall they’re both shitty people
"It's integrated, moderated, owned by a public company, and run by a guy whose weird libertarian tech larks are at least provably sensitive to market realities. It's also the fastest growing consumer application in internet history. It took Tik Tok nine months to hit 100 million users. ChatGPT took two months. Threads has almost hit that in *two days*. You would have to be insane to stick with Twitter at this point if you were an advertiser."
Zuck's monopolization of social media is almost complete.(He's missing a TikTok/ Youtube killer.)
[deleted]
"I didn’t consider that angle. Now I’m surprised they didn’t have a Twitter clone up way earlier, though I guess they had to strike at the right time (which seems to be now)"
Aka a huge monopoly. Lol everyone cheering on zuck to take over all of social media is baffling to me.
Plus there might be bundle discounts if you put your ads on all the meta platforms. Saving a little coin is always a good thing.
"Reminds me of Microsoft. Teams might be shit 50% of the time but because it comes with most office 365 subscriptions and is integrated, companies just use it instead of buying any alternatives."
"it's also attractive because no NSFW, and it appears to actually be moderated"
I feel like certain types lawsuits are usually the last thing to get defunded if the ROI is high enough. Say this suit goes forward and Twitter files for bankruptcy. The suit will still be litigated because the outcome can impact the value of the assets in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy Court could also force a stay in the Twitter/Meta litigation while bankruptcy proceeds. US bankruptcy has a lot of hard baked protections and an aggressive fine system if counter parties pierce the bankruptcy shield.
"I don’t think there’s an alternate path - let people speak freely from behind a safe screen, vitriol follows. All of these forums - Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, comment sections, wherever - eventually devolve into the base appeal of punching down. In a quarter century +, we haven’t yet cracked how to get people on internet spaces to default to kindness. It’s really weird to me yet totally unsurprising."
"I think Meta already abandoned FB, it's very Instagram focused currently but that will run it's course too, this seems like a future ready move. Gotta keep that data mining funnel somehow."
"Pre-Musk Twitter was always a bit ""rambunctious"" shall we say, but it's amazing how downright vile it's become since Musk took it over."
"The difference is they won’t be emboldened by an Elon Musk type running the platform to behave and act like little shits. Zuck won’t make sweeping changes to the platform to encourage and enable that type of behaviour, whereas musk has and continues to do so."
"From what I've seen, it seems Threads has *actual* moderation, and their right-wing fake news sh\*t is already not flying there, or it's at least being flagged as peddling false information as a warning to users. Some of the big right-wing influencers are already angry about this.Unlike Twitter, Threads is not coddling their bullshit."
"Threads will absolutely be more attractive to advertisers. You think advertisers care about data protection?  They don't want data protection and that's how Zuckerberg makes money. Lol. Meta has two products (Facebook and Instagram) with proven track records. If Threads keeps growing and makes money, it'll take over."
"i don't know who you mean by ""people"", but advertising is all about promises. and there's plenty of ad market for us only conpanies.but only time will tell of course."
"No one is expecting social media to change the internet. People are looking for an alternative to Twitter due to its myriad problems since Elmo took it over, which is why advertisers have fled in droves along with millions of users.And on the subject of advertisers, they don't care about data protection issues. Hell, advertisers are the ones who love exploiting users' data for better targeting. What they do seem to care about is having their brand tarnished by being associated with a site that allows racism, misogyny and right wing disinformation to run rampant or even encourages it, which is one of the reasons many have left twitter along with the millions of users."
EU is what 5% of global population?
Considering that Elmo bans everyone who calls him out on his stupid ideas or slanders them and calls them pedophiles there isn’t many good ideas on the platform being discussed anyway.
Twitter trying to limit its users next. When they lose 100M users Im sure Elon will claim they were all bots.
"Yup, this is correct. Twitter itself was still an attractive place for advertisers and casual users like me pre-Musk. Considering their two profitable years were recent, I'd argue TWTR was on an upward trajectory and they would have figured it out at some point, pulling in consistent profit.My feed now is just crap, a big part of why so many users are being pushed to install Threads. Advertisers will no doubt follow."
"Well, really he got caught with his hand in the Pump and Dump Scheme jar."
"He assumed that he could increase the value of his shares by making an offer that he could weasel out of. Then he failed to weasel out of it, because some laws still apply to him. By paying so much, he inflated the company’s debts such that it would be miraculous if he managed to earn enough to pay the interest. … so he started cost cutting. But he cost cut *everything.*"
"As a reminder, he memed himself into paying $5**4.20** a share for it. Which isn't even the first time he's fucked himself over with a 420 joke about stock prices; [the SEC took great interest in his 2018 ""joke"" tweet](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226) about taking Tesla private at $420 a share.Dude's got the sense of humor and maturity of a 5th grader."
"Speaking of drugs, Elmo looks like a guy who is progressively getting the alcohol/drug “puffy face” from decades of substance abuse. I think his mind is just turning into mush now."
Plus Elmo culled 80% of his workforce and has made his company a generally unattractive place to work for
Meta is spending 4 billion more on VR this year than last year.
"I think you would be amazed at how little Twitter's share ever was even at it's peak. Twitter in general is a much smaller platform than people unconsciously assume.It's worth it to Meta to make Threads because, why not? Twitter is wounded, might as well put a parallel system in place and take the traffic that's there. But it's not going to alter the company's bottom line in any appreciable manner OR change the advertising landscape because Twitter was never important to that landscape. On the moors of Scotland, Twitter was a single fencepost among a thousand acres of grass and sheep and stone walls.Okay... where the hell did I pull the metaphor from? Ignore it.But in direct response to your words...  Threads isn't going to kill Twitter. Musk is going to kill twitter. Threads is just showing up for the funeral."
"As bad as Musk is, why the fuck are we talking about handing more of the internet on a silver platter to Mark fucking Zuckerberg of all people as if it was a good thing?"
"The problem with Twitter is that ad targeting is fundamentally low quality, just like it is on Reddit. FB and IG have all kinds of other info to build a profile of their users on top of the tracking cookies. This lets you have incredible targeting. Twitter users are considered to be garbage from an ads point of view so nobody is going to spend for them."
"Thrived. Strive is to struggle, which it's doing in Musk's hands."
You don't become rich by actually paying people who do stuff for you.
"Office space, storage space, cloud services, software vendors, take your pick."

Narrator: *Several people have left arguments here*
You're the one who doesn't have an argument. Twitter is still censoring so what's your argument?
I’d like to point that other people have offered you more reasonable responses and you ignored there post and instead concentrated on those that insulted you. You are choosing the type of conversation you wish to have.

"That makes you an outlier, and not important, lol"
"We do follow people and waves of those we don't even know are shoved into our feed. I constantly have far right politicans and random political dickery show up on my feed despite how fast and frequently I block them. He has a narriative and an agenda he's pushing, a crowd he's pandering to, and a goal he's very poorly trying to reach."
Too soon buddy.. I mean it would have been alright but some guy just reset the timer.
Nah. The value of reddit is on existing content. Twitter content has no historical value in comparison
Of course they wouldn’t.
"It would probably still be a better app than Reddit's clunky garbage, and probably have fewer ads too."
"My third party app still works, so I honestly don't know if they just haven't pulled the plug yet or if spez is second guessing that decision."
"People are here because 3rd party apps still work.That being said, there's no denying the quality of r/all went down the toilet."
"Meh. They won't. Third party apps for Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook etc have a pretty big risk of getting banned"
">Do you think Meta would give free access for 3rd party apps?It doesn't necessarily have to be free. At ""reasonable cost"" would likely work.And if Reddit could ever figure out how to properly monetize, they likely could do it on ad revenue alone with a free API. Serving an API isn't altogether different than serving their native website/app from a cost standpoint. They just need to monetize it properly.Read the posts made by the 3rd party Reddit app developers. Most of them were willing to pay for the API, but the number Reddit asked for was astronomical."
Do you know what Meta also wouldn't have? Unpaid moderators running the place. ;)
"What makes you think the API thing will be the last of the bad decisions?He/they **really** want this site to start making *big* money. The API money grab is just the beginning. You are never going to get McDonalds, Pepsi or Tide to advertise along side BDSM porn or weird ass henti tentacle rape bullshit. So that shit is going to have to go. All of it.They also will need to do **a lot** more about piracy. Hell, they just replaced the moderators of r/piracy instead of nuking the subreddit, which they will have to do to make Hollywood and video game publishers happy.And I have to assume they will ""go after"" desktop users who are running adblockers eventually. I suppose the old.reddit crowd will be first. Followed by something like Twitch and YouTube are doing (blocking access to those running blockers) or maybe just discontinuing web access altogether.To be clear, I'm a desktop user, so I don't give a single fuck about API's. Only kids and idiots use their phones for shit like reddit. It's a **web forum** after all, it's a miserable experience on a tiny screen without a physical keyboard."
"No, but they would probably design a decent UI for their native apps. Facebook has some bloat but, the UI of Facebook, Instagram, and (now) Threads is lightyears ahead of Reddit. Apollo was better but, Facebook is pretty good. The ads are also nowhere near as obtrusive on Facebook and Instagram. I’ve got some serious questions about the business decisions Reddit had made. Most in the business community would tell you that 3rd party enterprises building a business atop your platform is a panacea… it’s why every company keeps trying to become a ‘platform’ but, I digress —- the real issue is that Reddit can’t seem to build a business model that supports them building a decent 1st party app. It’s worth it for the content to most but, nobody with a straight face can call it good."
"The thing is, Threads didn’t start out as open source like Reddit did, so that comparison is moot."
I'm already noticing a big shift in reddit this month.So many odd subreddits popping up in my feed that never used to pop up. Why is r/amiugly suddenly turning up in r/popular everyday? It's definitely starting to feel like content is changing and not for the better. To be honest the only reason I'm still here is because for whatever reason relay still works. As soon as that's done for I'm gone.
"The volume of hate speech and rampant racism and conspiracy nonsense is through the roof. It's not the app that's the problem, it's that he's given terrible people a green light to be terrible. I terminated my account about two weeks ago. It was a good choice."
Twitter allows left leaning people too.  I don't know why people think it's automatically far right just because they stop censoring the right.
Two small echo chambers is better than one big one. Divide and conquer and all that.
It’s still competition regardless of how you word it.
"So, it's competition. When a product is so good that consumers choose it over others, that's not ""minimizing competition,"" that's *what competition is for*."
So it's been a bit but iirc the tldr was that CA scraped a TON of data from FB(or their API) and then FB cut them off. Yes it was bad that the data got out but was FB negligent?

"I don't believe for a second that Meta hasn't built those capabilities into the application already--they say they are working on doing the reverse chronological follow-only feed as soon as possible, but I think right now they are trying to ""set the vibe"".

"They only started development on it in January of this year, directly in response to Musk buying Twitter"
"The original Threads was a private messaging app. This, which started development in January is completely something else. Completely from scratch."
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor)The article alludes to the crunch at the beginning of this week and what triggered it. I remember now it was the Verge's podcast on this same subject is where they specifically mentioned that Meta had their engineers working over the the weekend to onboard celebs and also to get the product out the door this week.Listening to the podcast is what pushed me to find and read this article.
"Yep. I created an instagram account just to get to threads. My local DOT isn't there yet, but most of the other useful twitter accounts I followed are. As long as I can go to one spot to get the information I need I'll be happy."
"As directly no but they are still competing. TikTok and instagram are different and weren't directly competing, but they still felt enough competition for the to add reels."
"But that's the thing. Most people have both so it made joining threads super easy. It's why Mastodon never took off. BlueSky couldn't handle the traffic. If Elon never bought Twitter, Threads would have stayed on the shelf."
You can also currently deactivate your Threads account without affecting your Instagram account.
"Usable mod tools from reddit have been coming soon since, *checks notes*, 2015."
"""Working on it."""
"Failing to have that on their base app, combined with the well documented difficulties with truly deleting facebook accounts, is not a good look. Facebook/zuckerberg/meta have a *very* long track record of ignoring any and all ethics in order to grab every bit of user info they can."
Never bet on any feature that isn't deployed yet.
"When ? How ?There is no such thing as a Threads account, what Zuckerberg is selling is a text add-on for Instagram.When you sign-up for Threads, all you are doing is making an Instagram account. There is a reason Threads doesn't have a desktop site."
"I tried starting a new Instagram account with a bogus name, but the account was ""banned"" the moment I created it. Guess they have ways of tracking if an account is phony? I don't know."
"its a good thing I don't have an instagram anymore, or facebook.  I nuked my instagram after I found CSAM on there and nothing was being done about it as some of it had been up for months, and some of the accounts posting had been posting it for months.  I reported it to the FBI, and yet it was still posting a month later.  I then proceeded to delete my account on instagram and facebook, as nothing of value was lost."
Wait. People on reddit are supposedly technology literate and yet they believe that pack of bullshit after all this time? People here are delusional.
"It’s roughly the same, but  Threads could “quite possibly start ramping up its aggressiveness similar to the likes of TikTok in hauling personal data from users as time passes.”Of course, if you don’t use Instagram, you should probably stay away from any Meta product. “New users should know that Threads is just another Meta app where user data is the product.” https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64a7ed45d35f00342a91cf1d/Threads-app-privacy-label-from-the-Apple-App-Store-displayed-on-an-iPhone-14-/960x0.jpg?height=1081&width=711&fit=bounds"
it isn’t even launching in Europe due to privacy regulationsedit: see comment below
"> from the tone of they're posts, they genuinely didn't expect anywhere near this number of signups this quick.People are desperate for a twitter alternative now that musk has quadrupled down on the stupidity."
I love it when redditors come to a conclusion in 5 seconds like that investors are being defrauded or mislead they think the investors themselves couldn’t have possibly come to that conclusion themselves. As if only Reddit posters know about bots or data collection or user counts
"Good god, thank you for saying this."
"Sorry but misrepresenting your userbase is fraud when social media valuations are generated with the same metric.When you “Hotel California” them, you are misrepresenting them."
right?? that dude may be a graduate from wallstreetbet
"They definitely were ready to pull the trigger at the maximum Elon-fucked-up moment. The limits introduced were the perfect spark. If something like this had happened in a month instead of now, I bet we don’t see Threads until then. Naturally, that means more things have to come to the app in live. I still think they made the best possible decision for the best possible outcome for Threads."
Kinda. I would expect the platform will be the easiest yet for Meta to more aggressively pursue more invasive data collection. There’s literally no point to Meta launching an entirely new product unless it significant improvements to their business model or overcome significant technical barriers in their other products.
"Yes.  Zuck essential just allowed himself to clone his subscriber base for an established social media company, and use it an unfair advantage to compete. Not that government regulators would understand tech well enough to know how dangerous this is. Investors absolutely care about metrics like “subscriber growth” for new products. Why do you think they’re spending so much ink on calling it the most successful social media roll out ever? and do you know what? So do advertisers. This is the first time in tech history a billion dollar company has just carbon copied the most important thing to their company to duplicate its value into a new company. It would be obvious how bad this is cheating if they just copied over the user base, but one click to sign up is the next best thing."
"You missed the the “installs the app”I hope you don’t think they need your email address to identify you 😂For starters, they know your phone number. They know everyone you know. They know the IMEI for your cell phone. Trust me, there’s no throw away account that will hide you, at the very least you need a burner phone with an empty contact list."
"They didn’t, also never. Threads isn’t even launching in Europe because they are struggling to make it work with EU privacy laws."
"Let me remind you that two decades ago, Microsoft was sued (and lost!) because they bundled their own web browser with their operating system and made it difficult for users to switch to something else.These days, you have companies that have their own operating systems (desktop and mobile), web browser, and a full range of devices, as well as several major platforms and tools that are used on these devices and operating systems, not to mention their own advertising platform based on the data collected via all of the above and a number of other services, including their own ISP and phone carrier… and the regulators don't even bat an eye.Or you have another multi-billion entity, which holds several popular web platforms, one of the most popular IMs and a bunch of other ventures, and just launched another one, which is ostensibly based on their other product to the point it can't be launched in the EU due to the new Digital Services Act. ;)I'm not saying that Meta can't launch a Twitter competitor. Anyone can. But when you're doing so by taking advantage of another service you own, while others have to start from scratch and reach their own critical mass, it's like competing in a marathon – but starting your run a mile from the finish line."
"[Twitter collects less data than threads](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-twitter-threads-bluesky-spill-hive-mastodon-privacy-comparison/), specifically it doesn’t include sensitive data like your name, your sexual orientation, if you’re pregnant, etc.Other social media alternatives to Twitter or threads like mastodon or blue sky collect significantly less data."
"[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy)[Threads](https://terms.threads.com/privacy-policy)While they are both Meta products, the fact WhatsApp was an acquisition that has baked some degree on privacy into the product engineering has allowed users to retain some degree of privacy. Facebook has been hacked together and innovated along the way, but all the privacy invasive features to be showcased in threads were certainly invented in Facebook.Threads on the other hand was designed from the ground up with all the lessons learned by Meta over the last decade in how to maximize surveillance."
"Imagine if the Dubai police one day decided they wanted the location history of everyone in the United Arab Emirates who was gay, along with their name and biometric data. Or Germany decided they needed to know the location of all the Jews in Europe. Threads will give this to you, Twitter will not. There’s some things that are none of anyone else’s business. There are other things that history tells us are simply dangerous to collect."
"I mean the easiest way to explain it, is that you’re essentially handing your phone to Meta and letting them summarize everything into a catalogue, and then sell access to anyone interested. Privacy minded people for example use Signal instead of WhatsApp. Telegram I think also has better privacy. They don’t install apps like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter. TikTok is the absolute worst of them. Blue Sky looks promising but it’s still invite only. Mastodon I think is probably the least invasive social media company that’s open.Then there’s the whole problematic collection of Google applications. It’s really something to be said that Apple is taking the crown of protecting its users privacy, but I’m not sure it’s doing that great of a job so much as protecting their access from competition."
Yep. Never underestimate the value of convenience. People innately expect technology to advance and improve. Nobody wanted to go from something with Twitter’s relative ease of access over to a platform that is harder to use. I think this is Lemmy’s big hurdle right now as well. It needs a better UX if it’s going to sell people on ditching Reddit for it
"Binding it to IG was a great idea for that reason, alone.    &nbsp;  If you have an instagram account you press like two buttons and now you're using Threads."
"I signed up for Mastadon and was slightly more clueless there vs Threads.My understanding is that Mastadon would benefit from some centralization (even if its incongruous with the initial vision.  A small Wikipedia type non-profit could maintain a homepage that people can trust, hell maybe just find a way to run Mastadon off of Wikipedia."
"Technically you only have to join/sign up to one server, which hosts your account. You can access and interact with other servers without signing up to them but it does mean the service overall is split up between dozens of websites. But once you follow someone, regardless of what server they're from, they'll appear in your main feed on the server your account is hosted from"
It’s literally on the right hand side called #explore
And his marketing was soo much better that Mastodon!
It sounds like Mastadon is going…*puts on sunglasses*…extinct.
"So, technically threads uses ActivityPub and they say they will open it to other instances in the future. If that happens you can follow threads users from mastodon."
Lemmy works pretty well. The Reddit-Concept works way better in a federated way than mastodon does
It's not rocket science.  We should be teaching agnostic computing skills to grade school ages.
Large companies always say something like that in the beginning. It’s a nice gesture at the very least though. But it will not be high on their features list nor JIRA backlog.
"A bunch of other Fediverse servers say they'll defederate from them, though."
Those Mastodon dudes know how to rock. Check them out if you haven't heard them.
"Nah it was pretty well covered on Twitter when Elon took over. But that said, it was DOA from the get go."
I love Linux Mint. But you're absolutely right.
"It's Twitter made by Facebook, it's the worst of both worlds."
Zuckerborg. He's going to merge with the machines soon.
I hate both of them equally but since Musk is literally handing over Twitter to Nazis this is my way to contribute to his demise. Zuck will fuck it up for himself on his own eventually.
"I'd imagine it's because of the moderation, atleast for now, FB has notoriously allowed all kinds of misinformation and conspiracies to thrive."
"Not saying it’s true, just that somebody should look into it!"
> and run by a guyWho doesn't accuse people of being a pedo on their platform.
Not to mention that Meta Ads are incredibly effective.  Honestly they're probably the best any company has to offer.  I can't tell you how many times I've bought stuff from them simply because the items were really interesting things that I had not ever considered but were well within my interests.
is threads apply as a standalone app since it was a built inside instagram while chatgpt and tiktok are their own applications?
">It's integrated, moderated, owned by a public company, and run by a guy whose weird libertarian tech larks are at least provably sensitive to market realities.the mention of market realities and Meta in the same sentence is legit funny... have you heard about the Metaverse? Or Facebook Creative Labs, Facebook Credits, their incredibly failed attempt at crypto right in the middle of the crypto boom?The only successful Meta products are products they bought from their competition like WhatsApp and Insta. They have no idea how any market works, they fail unless they buy what's already established and loved.&#x200B;>It's also the fastest growing consumer application in internet history. It took Tik Tok nine months to hit 100 million users. ChatGPT took two months. Threads has almost hit that in two days.well, forcing existing users onto the newest app from their universe is not organic growth, this is comparing apples with pears. TikTok and ChatGPT grew organically and crazy fast. Forced user migration is not organic, it's artificially prettifying sign up numbers. Google did the same with Google+ when they killed the Feedreader and the Blogspot hub, forcing everyone on Google+. Yeah, high  artificial growth numbers don't mean a thing, look at where Google+ is now.And forcing the user base of a picture based platform on a text based platform will absolutely guarantee a well managed, high quality community....  Not."
>You would have to be insane to stick with Twitter at this point if you were an advertiser.Very true. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users
As soon as Gen Z starts seeing too  many “ old people” on Tik Tok ( people over 35) they will leave just like they left Facebook for Instagram. A new competitor will inevitably show up. YouTube though seems the toughest nut to crack.
But there's already a TikTok-esque thing integrated into FB?
"Man I am WAITING for a YouTube killer. Not that I expect it to be any better with its algorithms or it’s aggressive ad placement, but just to see someone finally do it. That’s the one web service I can’t imagine ever getting toppled due to how integrated it is into the rest of the internet so it would be interesting to see how that plays out"
"In many countries, Facebook is the TikTok killer. Facebook shorts and streaming do really well in South America and Southeast Asia."
"I honestly think even the Threads people were surprised by the wildly successful launch (most product launch end in tears). They were super luckily that they have the IG social graph they can piggy back on top, but even with that I don’t think they predicted this kind of hate toward Elon and Twitter that in the end benefit them."
"As much as Zuck is a soulless android asshole, he's a pretty decent businessman. He seems to actually have some self awareness and even though he's really into the metaverse, backed off it when shareholders revolted. Opening a Twitter competitor right now is a no brainer if you already have a built in userbase and don't have to organically grow everything.  That's not to take credit away from him, businesses often overlook glaringly obvious opportunities and effectively destroy themselves from within."
"Launching a Twitter clone when Twitter was at its prime would be a pretty dumb idea – no one was going to leave Twitter, where they had everything set up, all their followers and follows, and all the content creators they were interested in.Launching it now, on the other hand… ;)"
"""Give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth""-Oscar Wilde"
"You think they abandoned the biggest, most successful social media platform on the planet with 3 billion monthly active users? This has to be purely a reddit comment and not an actual thought."
Are they still working on that vr meta world disaster?
"youre just seeing different shit, it was ALWAYS this way"
"I think Zuck  will follow the money and the algorhythem that goes with it. Example:Facebook's fact-checkers will need to stop fact-checking former President Donald Trump following the announcement that he is running for president, according to a company memo obtained by CNN.While Trump is currently banned from Facebook, the fact-check ban applies to anything Trump says and false statements made by Trump can be posted to the platform by others. Despite Trump's ban, ""Team Trump,"" a page run by Trump's political group, is still active and has 2.3 million followers.https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/11/15/politics/facebook-fact-check-donald-trump/index.htmlZuck had it both ways here, he gets to virtue signal to the left about banning Trump while giving the go ahead to the right to use misinformation. He's just less honest about it then Musk."
That's some interesting news! Who on the right is complaining?
"""People"" probably means Twitter is a cesspool because people are unruly filth."
But still with more money than 80% of the global population.
"The US is 5%, the EU is 10%"
Yep. He massively screwed over the company by hastily cutting the work force that much. There seems to be story after story of twitter trying to hire back key people bc turns out no one knows how to fix x thing etc. Don’t get me wrong. Twitter very well may have had more employees than they needed but it takes time to properly figure out who is actually necessary or not. Musk just charged in with a wrecking ball.
"I don’t think Musk could kill Twitter on his own without directly shutting it down, but if there is a viable option then the combination of that and Musk could do it."
"The media always gives Twitter far more attention and power then it actually deserve sand they only care about it now because Musk bought it and they love covering him which is the real reason he bought I in the first place, clout and attention. Musk became a totally different animal after he went on Rogan’s podcast, he's a straight up attention whore now."
"In a way Zuck already did something like that offering Facebook as an alternative to MySpace, slowly pushing them out to the point of irrelevancy."
"Hmmm... In this context, I feel like Threads is the grocery store butcher carving up and serving the carcass up to the public in nice pink slices. Poultry is all the rage these days after all. Tweet tweet mother fucker, pass the salt please."
"Stealing that metaphor, thanks! :D"
"Elon Musk is just learning from his daddy. Daddy Musk says, ""Don't pay fairly for work but also do fuck family members."" Now we just have to wait and see if Elon sleeps with family members too."
"You become temporarily rich. But if you want to be permanently rich, you learn how to pay people."
There is a reason he admires the Chinese 996 system
"Ok, that’s one point. You conveniently chose to ignore my other points and are fixated on one thing in particular and that’s your whole argument lmao!Are you also conservative by any chance?"
“Everything is Nazism”I have a feeling you call everything communist
Everything is Nazism is absurd.
"If everything you like is repeatedly referred to as nazism, perhaps you might be into nazism"
"By Nazi’s, many of us mean the alt-right. We typically use them interchangeably because they have nearly a 100% overlap. Genuinely curious, have you not seen blue check marked accounts talking about “differences” between the races, dog whistling Jewish conspiracies, and advocating for a White ethnostate? Because I see these posts and comments daily.Also, I’d encourage you to look at my most recent post on my Reddit profile. It shows exactly what I’m talking about."
He literally blocked reporters for reporting on a story he published……. So let’s stop pretending it’s about free speech. It’s not. It’s just that musk is very tolerant of bigotry and dislikes opposing view points. Specifically anyone who disagrees with him. Something you are well aware of unless you have been living under a rock.
"Yes, we don't share the same values. I value Nazis not being able to praise Hitler and asking for Jews to be murdered on social media. That's your values and that makes you a Nazi. Now go fuck yourself."
Bec these people want to be coddled and never have to deal with the cold hard world. They think stringing a sentence together on twitter is being an activist for causes they believe in. Calling people Nazis makes them feel powerful yet they have no idea what they’re even saying bec they’re just brainwashed shit stains.
And your point is? I suppose you read all the dogshit they fed you in your random ass feed.Teens have lot of spare time
They were rich though
Threads supports ActivityPub which means it could interact with Mastodon instances. So there's always a chance that they see the value 3rd-party integrations provided and allow them under a more reasonable pricing structure.
"But maybe they'd put competent people in charge and have an actual, functional app. The official Reddit app is the biggest steaming pile of shit I've ever used. I gave it an honest try after July 1st and didn't make it a day. Videos I didn't even click on where playing in the back ground, images where loading over top of chat. The while GUI was a freaking headache. Spez copy/pasted how they would ""be better"" and know of the apps shortcomings, well why the fuck didn't they fix their app before the API changes?  Boggles my fucking mind."
"But their first party product wouldn't suck, esp for moderation, which is why the APIs are necessary at all."
"they do RIGHT NOW lol, you can go to the developer site and check. that's the whole business model - free entry and monetization on ads."
I tried threads. Oh boy it scrolls smooth. On my 120hz phone it looks quite nice.Reddit official app scrolling is choppy as hell. Feels like I'm using an old piece of crap phone. Boost was smooth. Sync was smooth. Blah.
Not all 3rd party apps left. Some could make it with the transition to paid API others couldn't.
Do you think Meta would provide 3rd party apps for a reasonable cost? They make too much money off their ads.
Oh it’s at least partly the app that’s the problem. They way blue cheeks are promoted and the attempt to stifle view counts for non-paying users was definitely an assault on the app’s usability
"They never censored ""the right."" They censored misinformation and violations of their terms of service. The fact that mostly came from the right is a self-own."
"Its not like you have to show your ""i hate the left"" id card to join the teitter clones. Its just that anytime a site proclaims to be about free speech it gets filled up by these people."
So do you not agree that having a monopoly is minimizing competition or do you not agree that this will cause a monopoly?
It was a university researcher who took info from a “personality test app” they had launched and gave that data to CA against the terms of service.
"The whole story turned out to be pretty much false, too. It was essentially a scam that accidentally looked like it accomplished something because trump won."
"And of those that “remember” it, probably 95% don’t have any of the facts right about what happened."
Do you? Do I?
"Threads doesn't seperate account info from Instagram, EU laws don't allow that, so they're still working on it. Contrary to popular belief EU didn't ""ban"" Threads because it's more invasive or anything. Threads is basically just another feature of Instagram that comes in a different app"
"It's not banned, it's not yet launched due to EU requirements."
His personality is surely enough? Then add in the fact he’s turned into some weird conspiracy theorist.
"He calls a lot of strangers pedos for disagreeing with him, for starters. It’s like his go to insult"
Transphobic
"> all used Zuck's platforms to spread misinformation,Just like they use twitter, reddit, any social media out there"
Never happened.
> They literally had to rebrand as Meta because of all the heat over political disinformation.Do you have some literal evidence for that statement? :)
Sure. Agreed. Content moderation is a hella hard problem though. Again meta isn’t good. I agree. Elons twitter is worse.
Calling Twitter an open road is absurd.
"no, you don't understand, it *federated*"
Which is exactly the problem Threads is going to solve. Potentially.  More people are going to dip their feet in with Threads.
Moderation is not a word for censorship? Or moderation is an uninteresting word for censorship?
"Nah it's fine, I'm sure lots of people will love it. I don't look down on people for wanting to chill out with stupid influencer content when they get a precious hour of free time from their hellish jobs."
Also I said on FB a few weeks ago that I had COVID and now I’m being consistently fed COVID misinformation and other right-wing talking point bullshit. No matter how often I say “show me less shit like this” it keeps coming. All because of a single post.FB and Meta are cancer. The algorithm deciding what you should be fed is broken.
Really? The verified accounts on the top of every comment section shilling off topic memes and crypto doesn’t bother you?
"Tweet engagement went way down. My feed is nothing I want to see anymore. I can't even see the proper analytics of my tweets anymore. I need to pay to get any traffic now? Hurst my feelings? You truly think its more free now? You realize that the censor ship went up since Musk took over, right?"
"> I just use it for connections in my careerI use GRINDR, much more effective."
Have you been to r/LinkedInLunatics yet?
"Pimp out the profile as much as you can with all your skills and certs, no matter how minor, follow rules of writing resumes. For example one of my jobs says:https://i.imgur.com/4yHzijh.pngActive language, list of tech, etc etc there's endless guides and then the recruiters will come to YOU, not the other way around."
"Sure, but we judge games and apps by the features they have, not the features they said they’ll have or what features they promise.I’ll agree with you once these features come, but until then, it doesn’t not essentially function as twitter"
That’s like saying teslas are going to be self driving
Typical opinion copy paster
"If he would stop creating his own problems, his bullshit might be defendable.But dudes completely lost the plot.But then again, Pretending to be your own child to mock the mother is a totally sane thing to do."
Says the one calling everything they don't like Nazism or some form of buzzword.
"If you frame the argument as ""Twitter doesn't own the concept of online communication"" instead of the real argument of ""Twitter owns their own code"" then you really have no idea what you're talking about.Nobody is saying Twitter is the only website like it that's allowed to exist. Elon never sued Truth Social. What Elon is alleging is the programmers who were fired from Twitter and hired by Meta used *the same code* that was owned by Twitter.If I quit LexisNexis I can't go Experian and copy/paste the code I used at LexisNexis. That is owned by LexisNexis, not me, and I'm not allowed to make my own version of it that's exactly the same.For being something all of you have **literally no idea about** because it's a brand new news story there's only one reason I can think why'd you'd feel so righteously indignant, and it's because you just want to see the ""other political side"" fail. That's why you're largely ignored by the rest of the population."
I guess if you are at your rate limit then no active shooter alert for you
Zuckabug will make the same mistake. It'll just take awhile for optimization creep to overshoot its mark in favor of money.
the trick to twitter is never let it pick what you see.use lists and a good third party app built around columns of lists.use searches on hashtags sparingly for live events.the greatest use for twitter is Transit updates and science project announcements.
Interesting you would look to Twitter and search the game for the dodgers score and not just use the MLB App. Unless that was just an example usage of Twitter.
There's a little secretStop watching Tate and Peterson 😀I'm on twitter and I have never seen their messages
"No I mean the people making polls about Jews running the world.  Also I’m not American, I don’t give a shit about American conservatives, I do hate Nazis though."
Google^^google unlocks a seventh brain no one knows where is
I agree especially with the last point. It doesn't matter if it would've failed or not because Meta seems like a more rational company (compared to whatever Elon's got going on there) and just wouldn't  have released threads if there was no big gaping whole left by Elon.
"Most people don't have both. Instagram has 2 billion MAU, Twitter around 240 million. So about 1.76 billion use Instagram and not Twitter."
"You can ""*deactivate*"" your threads account.But if you want to delete it, you have to delete everything you have posted manually, or nuke your Instagram."
"Also I’ve been on threads since it started and the pervasive attitude there is “this place is for fun, you will be shunned for live laugh love platitudes in yoga pants as your sole personality here, same with being exclusively political, just be your real doofus self”, which is nice. You can use a button on everyone’s profile to check their insta to see what kind of posts they make there, which makes it easier to block and unfollow people who don’t fit the vibe you want on your feed."
"And hundreds of other companies have announced a feature and delivered on it. What Reddit does or doesn't do means shit for what Meta says or does, so I don't really get why you would bother to bring it up. It's not relevant."
"Meta has extremely competent developers on staff and has made  significant advancements in the industry, many of which was made open source.Reddit developers, on the other hand, couldn't figure out how to handle underscores in strings."
Winds of Winter from GRRM released in 2017… oh wait
But are they allowed to pull data without consent or is that possible? Isn’t that against the App Store policy in case for apple? Or do big company work together to divide the bread??
"It's not launching in Europe because there's no account data separation between Instagram and Threads, which EU regulation doesn't allow. The storage systems have to be isolated from each other. There's nothing about the data collection for Threads that makes it better or worse than Instagram or Facebook.Meta says they're working on this and will launch in the EU shortly. The likely reason this wasn't already the case is because it greatly simplified their account creation process and backend infrastructure, so they could launch the app and gain users quickly."
Isn’t that due to its linking itself to Instagram- not increases in scope to data collection
"They will do, they just have to follow the regulatory process."
Erm threads exists in Europe. I have it
"I used to love Twitter. back when I was a specific kind of ""journalist"" and was interacting with a big community of like minded folk.twitter was a little wild, slightly scary, and a lot of fun. but all under the users control. you followed the things and people you were interested in, and ignored the rest easily because you didn't choose to have it in your feed. and a great place to generally keep up with stuff that was happening in the world. a true digital ""public square."" that magic has been lost. and replaced by only the worst aspects of what twitter was.I'd love a replacement, but not sure if Threads is it. but in the interim, watching Musk squirm is fine."
"Users are a secondary metric. The bottom line is ad revenue. If Meta’s ad revenue plummets, it doesn’t matter if the users claimed are half the human population. The stock will go down. At the end of the day, Meta has one of the most successful advertising gigs behind Google. The same people who make ridiculous claims have never read an earnings report or held a single share of a company. But I guess you’d find the same quality of discussion on Twitter and Meta too so…"
Thank you for knowing I’m not alone. Fucks sake man
">Yes. Zuck essential just allowed himself to clone his subscriber base for an established social media company, and use it an unfair advantage to compete.  >  >(...)  >  >This is the first time in tech history a billion dollar company has just carbon copied the most important thing to their company to duplicate its value into a new company.You probably meant trillion dollar company (which Meta isn't, but close enough). Also, that is a false statement. They have released many (failed) apps that share the login and network. [Including an app by the same name that they shut down in 2021](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end/). The only difference with this launch is that there is a very real need and desire by the users for this product and they are meeting that need at the right time.>Investors absolutely care about metrics like “subscriber growth” for new products.I mean, sure they do, when that's the only thing they have to go on. But, as I mentioned:1) the account deletion feature (which you called out) has 0 impact on subscriber growth2) Meta is a public company so they will have to release quarterly metrics on active users, which is what investors and advertisers *really* care about.And if we're talking about advertisers, what they care about even more than subscriber growth and active users is a couple of things that Threads will kick Twitter's ass at:1) Brand safety (Twitter is a dumpster fire)2) ROI on ad spend (Meta is the best in the business)So, TL;DR:\- Many apps have been created by Meta with shared login/network, but since they didn't thrive, you weren't even aware. Now that it worked, it was an ""unfair advantage"" and ""should be regulated"".\- Users want a serious alternative to Twitter\- Advertisers will probably much prefer this alternative to Twitter"
"I have ""illegally"" changed my IME number via rooting and a China phone.( picked up a ""legal"" number via a broken phone from the scrap dealer) And an empty contact list. Now  Zuck can Kiss my Ass !"
"Microsoft was never ordered to not bundle their browser though, just to allow 3rd party manufacturers to bundle whatever browser they wanted as well as give access to some proprietary protocols. It would be similar to if google forced Samsung to use chrome by default instead of their own god-awful browser.And I don't really agree with the idea that you can't use your current service to help promote / use your other service. I imagine a world where google is unable to have ""maps"", ""images"", ""news"" at the top of searches, and you have to have a different login for each. No thanks."
"> Microsoft was sued (and lost!) because they bundled their own web browser with their operating system and made it difficult for users to switch to something else.It's cool that you know that microsoft had a lawsuit one time, but it has literally nothing to do with this.  1.  Threads isn't ""bundled"" with anything...you have to go deliberately download it or you don't have it.  2.  They in no way ""make it hard to switch to something else"".  What, you think if you become a threads user you are somehow now challenged if you want to open the twitter app?  Or bluesky? or whatever?  There is nothing even resembling anything that is ""difficult to switch to something else"" either.Yes, they made two apps that use the same login account, but that shares zero similarities with anything microsoft did or faced consequences for."
"I think that Sensitive Info flag on the app store page is a bit misleading. That information isn't anywhere explicitly on your phone, it doesn't really collect it from there, and it's an optional disclosure. They may try to derive it from things they do know and use it in the advertising profiles, but it's not an actual data access permission."
"Twitter maybe, but Elon Musk might"
I wish I could figure out how to get started with Mastadon or Signal. Unfortunately I'm not a power user of any of these apps. I just want to open it and read some popular stuff and close it. Trying to figure out a server and stuff is just completely impenetrable for me.
"I saw someone post a 10k word ""simplified"" guide for just signing up for Lemmysays it all really"
"Also Lemmy is founded/run by neo nazis and tankies that still keep your data after you ""delete"" it, so its a no go for me."
to be clear I think the UX for this stuff is pretty piss poor on mastodon and it feels inaccessible and obtuse even to me as a pretty tech savvy person. But yeah the functionality is there it's just a bit difficult to find and interact with.
"While that’s true, and the concept of “many connected servers” is relatively simple, it makes starting on Mastodon more complicated.Which server do I choose? There are a lot to choose from, some of which cater to specific groups. How do I find people I know? If their account isn’t on the same server as you, you need to know their full address.The interface is not user friendly. The makers of Tweetbot came out with Ivory, which is identical to Tweetbot, and there are others as well, but you have to be interested enough to give them a try.Tbh, while I think it will matter to some people that Mastodon is part of the Fediverse as opposed to another Big Tech company, I think the majority just want somewhere where they can make an easy transition - easy signup, and easy to find follows."
That's also what I see immodestly if I visit for example https://mastodon.world/
"Nonsense. Mastodon is small but the user base surged in November 2022. While lots of people created accounts and then didn't subsequently use them, the overall amount of users has continued to grow. You can see surge and decay patterns in every social media platform.   Mastodon isn't going anywhere."
"If it's anything like Lemmy, everyone is talking about un-federating because Facebook is evilWhich while likely true, seems short-sighted to me but whatever"
"I agree despite apparently all the down votes. Plus they have serious app muscle behind them (sync, boost) that can only help simplify the UI plus increase attention."
"Mastodon is the Linux of social media, I love and use Linux but it's true."
"So true. Im still waiting for Apple to open source their iMessage protocol.Edit: was pointed out that it was facetime, not imessage."
"Nah, they'll just do that and then pull the same shit [Google did with XMPP](https://ploum.net/2023-06-23-how-to-kill-decentralised-networks.html) back in the day."
"It's probably pretty high on the list other than making Threads GDPR compliant for the EU and fixing actual bugs.There's basically no downside for them, joining the Fediverse means they might get more users who might switch over to Threads just to be able to have one app that can reach everywhere, they don't have to spend a penny hosting those Fediverse instances, still get to serve ads and collect data from the users who might otherwise be using a Lemmy app."
"yea, people who randomly call other people pedos online really should be looked into"
Elon out here making Zuck look humane.
Right? Like I’ve got problems with Zuck but Elon is off the fucking deep end
I think it's worth noting that the person he accused of being a pedophile wasn't just some random guy. He was a fucking hero who was largely responsible for those kids in Thailand being rescued from that cave. Elon was butthurt because the guy didn't want to use Elon's moronic death tube to pull the kids out of the cave.
"Meta should take out ads…“Come to Threads, the CEO won’t accuse you of being a pedophile.”"
This is as true before apple gutted the platform with their privacy measures.  FB isn’t the advertising darling it was a few years ago.
Tbh when I’m bored and wanna shop a little I’ll open ig haha. FB used to be the same for me in that they always had ads for products I actually wanted
"Google is still slightly better due to their search business is pure intend, and FB has been hurt pretty badly due to Apples’ Privacy policy changes. To put it another way, FB ads used to be even better but now it’s slightly gimped."
this reads like an ad
"Honestly, Zuck is kinda smarter than Elon on managing these social media sites (if we forget his metaverse lol). I don't have accounts on these anymore but I always thought FB Marketplace saved FB, one of their smartest move in recent years."
"Only reason I keep Facebook is for the local marketplace. I scored a brother printer for $35. I don’t print a lot. I’ll probably never run out of toner. When I’m ready to buy a motorcycle, or replace my shitty car with another slightly better easier to fix shitty car, guess where I’m going?Plus the local county group is where I hear about all the local events."
Threads *is* its own application.
How is it forced? You have to download a separate app to be counted as a Threads user.
"Meta’s only successful products were bought?  Have you forgotten about Facebook, which is still the largest social network to date?It’s hilarious how many paragraphs you wrote about forced migration when there was no forced migration.  You have to download a completely different app altogether to be counted as a Threads user.  If they forced everyone on Instagram to migrate, Threads would now have 2.4 billion users, not 86 million."
Did you really just do the not thing
"Dude, the insta acquisition was over 10 years ago. The service back then had really nothing to do with what it is now (largely hipster sepia filters in those days).Facebook legit did a ton of work to evolve it to the behemoth it is now."
"YouTube is incredibly hard to crack because the only way it remains profitable is by linking it's services to other things Google owns. On the initial observation, it's always been unprofitable but combined with other Google data tracking it's proved invaluable.As zuck's suite of services grows it's entirely possible he could try his hand at it but as it stands trying to provide a service like YouTube by itself and not linked to other services is a profit loss disaster."
">“ old people” ( people over 35)As a millennial, this hurt more than it should have. Even with the quotes."
Hehe butt crack
Reels on Instagram
"It's less likely to be toppled not due to the integration, but to the massive, massive cost of hosting."
"Meta has some of the top product designers, I don't think they where surprised by the success. It looks more well planned than a happy surprise."
"I grew up with Kodak factories literally in my neighborhood, so I've certainly seen one example of a very large business overlook glaringly obvious opportunities."
My favorite is the [Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19/green-blackboards-and-other-anomalies) from Penny Arcade.
"“Facebook” isn’t even the company name anymore. The format has become standard like email, it just *is* now. Investing in Instagram to compete with the behemoths that is tiktok has taken far more of Meta’s energy. I wouldn’t say abandoned, but heavily deprioritized."
Libs of tiktok account got their transphobic posts deleted they are losing it over on twitter.
"""Libs of Tiktok"" and ""DC\_Drano"" are two I can think of from the top of my head that got their Threads profiles flagged as potentially peddling false information. Not completely banned, but have warnings that they peddle BS. They're furious over on Twitter because of it."
I think he thought he could do whatever he wanted and the users would take it.   Everybody has their limit.
"He can financially afford to let  it bleed revenue for years till he gets bored and sells it but the Zuck competition stokes the only real thong that motivates him anymore, his ego."
Remember Tumblr? It’s still a thing. So you are right. Social Media is still a pretty big business. The network effect of Twitter will still be here for years to come even without Elon.
.... shutting it down is a real possibility. The asshat isn't paying bills and has fired most of the people that know how to keep it running.
">The media always gives Twitter far more attention and power then it actually deserveI believe that it's mostly because Twitter got legitimised by governments, politicians, international organisations, media organisations, as well as celebrities and other famous people.No one gave a single crap about what was going on online when it was just nerds, geeks, researchers, random bloggers and other content creators, hobbyists and so on.But then, when you have a website where you can follow your president, prime minister, the European Commission, the Queen of Great Britain and the Pope – suddenly it's serious business. ;)"
"No. You never have to pay people. Just keep getting temporarily rich, again and again and again. Then you won't run out of being rich"
He obviously is.

So much hate… how are you any different?
Honestly they paid more to do that than my house is worth. I’m not going to feel bad.
"If they actually follow through with this, it'll be a game changer, as activitypub is starting to show up all over. Yes, Mastodon, but also WordPress, and a long list of others. We might be heading back to one of my favorite periods in Web history, RSS feeds. Seriously, that would be awesome.... But, it's FB, who are one the new Microsofts, so Embrace, Extend, Extinguish is also a possibility.I am allowing my jaded net veteran's soul approximately 10mm of hope."
"I also like how it seems to refresh and log you back in at random. It uses a *shitload* of data, too."
"they currently do for facebook, anyone can make facebook login. They make money off ads so why charge for API access? You want traffic to your site anyway and its easier with metas dev APIs.source: worked in developer ops for marketing companies. youd be surprised how much is free and public from google and meta. its all an ecosystem game"
What if serving ads were required as part of the API usage agreement?
"What lot of lefties call ""misinformation"" is just opinions they don't agree with though. Don't fall for their BS."
"I think that a monopoly disallows competition from forming. It's anti-consumer because it reduces choice and stifles innovation.Simply offering a new, best product is pro-consumer, because it adds another choice and encourages innovation, even if 99% of users flock to it. It also does nothing to prevent others from making their own, better Twitter clone.I think creating Threads is an example of the latter, though of course its usage isn't nearly that high yet.If you prefer to use a definition of monopoly that's not anti-consumer and merely means ""high usage,"" we can use that, we should just be clear that that isn't bad."
"Yeah, there is really no way to reliably and accurately assess the impact of any ad campaigns as a result of CA obtained data."
No it didn't
"We're not taking about those other platforms here though. Try to stay on subject. If your response to having people point out that Zuck's platforms were used as tools to coordinate and commit violence and spread misinformation is to go, ""but everyone else does it too!"" then you need to reassess your priorities.If you're looking for me to defend ANY social media, including this one, then you're barking up the wrong tree. The world would be better without social media and if they all disappeared tomorrow I'd be perfectly ok with it."
"Oh no, everything you posted is gone because the server owner went schizo?Whoopsie!"
"Is all moderation censorship? If yes, is censorship a bad thing?If yes, are censoring hate speech and child pornography bad things?"
"Not sure what you are even talking about. I skim through the latest tweets a few times a day and move on. Rarely do I read people's comments on tweets. Perhaps I'm in the minority as a lighter user, but to say the experience is ""horrid"" and he ""destroyed the platform"" is hyperbole in my eyes, and I feel that way even if some annoying comments shilling crypto are there. There may have been a few changes but it is pretty much fundamentally the same if you step back to look at it.But I also don't sit here hating Elon because the MSM told me to do so when he didn't agree with banning anyone who dare hold an opinion that isn't approved by the Ministry of Truth, nor am I some rabid fan boy who thinks he is amazing and infallible. I'm sure my perception of Twitter would be skewed if I thought he was literally the Devil for letting people say things that other people don't like OR he is Jesus incarnate and shits rainbows, but I don't, so it isn't."
How’s the Threads feed any better? It’s all random Elon hate and memes from people you don’t follow. At least Twitter let’s your choose between “For You” and a timelined “Following”.

So it's Musk's fault that nobody cares what you have to say? That's rich.
"Nice thank you, I happen to be in the market for a job depends who replaces my boss who just left 😏"
Well then get specific. What gets censored on Facebook that you think should be permitted?
"Except I never described in my post what I classified as ""Nazism"", therefore you're just projecting your own bullshit onto me and making all sorts of bad assumptions about who and what I must be talking about. Next time try going on what someone actually wrote, not what you conjured up in your little mind to project onto them."
Yawn. You talk too much
"You know, I didn't even think about that, but twitter really did flush its utility as a safety tool with the 1-2 punch of verification changes and rate limiting."
That's what you get for abusing your tweet limit!
This is the bullshit with reddit now. I hate that if I even glance at a post I'm flooded with nonsense from that sub. Like wtf. If I want more I will subscribe. It's line red dots only function
Or just Google the score
"Go to trending topics. Even when set on ""For You"" the recommended videos always have them."
I mean even them do you trust zuck to not store copies? Once you sign up the cat’s out of the bag
"probably not. to be EU GDPR compliant the company needs to be able to provide all your data and you can request it to be deleted. Threads will get slapped with the same or higher fines as they are currently facing and trying to appeal. As long as the courts stay strong, eventually Meta should bend the knee."
"That's what they said, the ability to delete just Threads is on the way."
The difference is that they have to allow you to delete threads in order to offer the app in the EU
"these guys navigate the business world with superstition, pattern recognition, and hearsay. The only real way we can predict actions of a company is previous behavior of that company, their stated goal, and finances."
Jesus Christ this place has gotten toxic.
And now we are defining Zuckerberg and Meta ?
"It's not a question of competence, it's a question of choice (money).Reddit chooses not to have competent developers/implement code by competent developers.The question is, are you putting your faith in Facebook's choices?"
"I'm wondering this too. Instagram asked for permission to access my contacts, but I declined. Given that Android requires your OK to share data with an app (and I though iOS was even more strict), I don't see how they can collect much without your consent."
"Data from other apps has to be approved to be shared on iPhone, so it's just data you give them willingly and any interaction in the app. People just assume Facebook == evil/shit/whatever when literally every single company and website does the same tracking and data harvesting."
And the US is a much more profitable market.
"I'm not in Europe but I'm gonna wait for that too, don't have an IG account and don't plan on making one just for Threads, especially since I'm probably not spending a lot of time there"
"Storage systems have to be isolated? What an ignorant stone age take on software regulation.Edit: people downvoting me, can you please explain the purpose and reasoning behind it?"
"Yeah if you look at the URLs for all the images and content it’s still using an instagram cache and backend. Kind of funny the EU tells companies they have to effectively double their infra costs (the team I lead at a top 10 tech company spends about nearly a billion a year) and then gets mad at any attempt to monetize the product via ads knowing full well it’s literally impossible to scale a social network with ad targeting due to needed network effect (if a social network isn’t free there won’t be a network in the first place)“You’re the product being sold” is one of the dumbest things we’ve trained people to recite without critical thinking. Meta doesn’t sell your data because it’s super valuable to them. They allow brands to target ads to you based on the data you’ve collected. That’s completely different. How do I know? Look at Brandwatch and Talkwalker. Their business models are literally scrape and buy all data on the internet for the purposes of marketing teams to monitor their brand mentions (eg Pepsi wants to know who talks about Pepsi). The only companies that sell it to them are Twitter and Reddit and both have massive contracts with data audits about how the data can be used and moved around. Facebook and Instagram data they can only scrape first party data and what their bots can do, Meta tries everything to block this.I wish people would have more critical thinking around this stuff. The EU is effectively led by anti-business populists passing things that sound good on paper but lead to regulatory capture. Regulation is absolutely necessary but the EU has essentially led to every company having shitty cookie banners, an EV charger 5x bigger and heavier than what the US has been moving towards and delays in customers receivingre: Monopolies Remember the movement to break up Microsoft and mandate other browsers? Didn’t matter, an open source project with 5 guys made a browser with tabs and had more market share in a few years. Most monopolies naturally fail or are attacked by startups because it means profits exist. Exceptions being natural monopolies (water, power, cabling). The biggest monopoly in tech historically (AT&T) only existed because government patents prevented new entrants. Instead of invalidating patents The idea of breaking up Amazon or Meta into multiple smaller companies would backfire so hard but i’d almost like to see them try and see the revolt when 1 day shipping now costs $350 a year instead. Also if you’re a CEO, why would you ever invest in innovation or optimization if you live if fear of getting broken up?"
Corporations have already won. It’s not possible to avoid data collection if you want to interact with any sort of smart phone in the modern world.
"Its to do with the Digital Markets Act coming into effect next year.&#x200B;>The DMA establishes a set of competition rules for the largest digital gatekeepers, including many U.S. tech giants such as Meta. Under the rules, digital gatekeepers must not preference their own services on their platforms and must ensure their instant messaging services are functional with those of competitors.At the moment there is a good chance Apple, Google, Facebook, etc may have to remove  some features from their EU markets or share proprietary tech."
"> so they could launch the app and gain users quickly.Exactly. Once they get the numbers they want, they will comply with the EU regulations."
"yes, because they need to figure out the new digital markets act"
what are the worst aspects that twitter has become
Yes I just always love that some redditors think they have the inside track on this stuff after and those dum-dums over at Blackrock have their heads up their asses and couldnt possibly understand the situation like they do
It doesn’t matter that it’s a secondary metric. It’s used in decision making therefore the company is liable to accurately report it.
">Yes, they made two apps that use the same login account, but that shares zero similarities with anything microsoft did or faced consequences for.Other than the fact that you have one company (Meta) running Facebook, one of the most popular social media platforms on this planet;  Instagram, which also ranks among the most popular social media platforms on this planet; WhatsApp and Messenger, which rank among the most popular IMs, and now Threads, which might as well become the next Twitter – too early to tell.I'm citing the Microsoft case to illustrate one point – two decades ago that was enough to get you hit with an antitrust lawsuit. Two, actually – one in the US, and one in the EU; the latter of which gave us the Browser Choice window. These days you have one enormous conglomerate with a near-chokehold on the social media market – and people are cheering for it. And they are allowed to merge and acquire their way to total dominance, they are allowed to use one of their services to bolster another service, because why not; they are allowed to share data between their products, and they are allowed to make it so you can't delete one account without also deleting the other one. >What, you think if you become a threads user you are somehow now challenged if you want to open the twitter app? Or bluesky? or whatever? There is nothing even resembling anything that is ""difficult to switch to something else"" either.Nope – but by essentially allowing every single one of their 2.4 billion Instagram users to easily join Threads (again – thanks to the fact that they are run by the same company, which is somehow allowed to do so) they make it virtually impossible to successfully start-up and launch an actual competitor. Dorsey might have the wherewithal to re-launch Twitter, but he sure as hell isn't going to have 70 million users in two days. No other developer can compete with that. So, yeah. I fully believe that Instagram should be its own company. Threads should be its own company. Oculus should be its own company. They should operate independently, they shouldn't share accounts or data, and they shouldn't be allowed to do whatever they are doing right now.But unfortunately, we're not in the ""lawsuits for bundling a browser with your OS"" era – we're in the day and age where you can build a company that controls several of the most popular platforms on Earth and everything is hunky dory ;)"
"Yes if I’m straight or gay (for example) isn’t explicitly on my phone, but if an app is collecting this data and offering it for sale, then they have to disclose the collection to be listed in the App Store or Apple can pull their app for violating the terms of service. So it’s not an optional disclosure, it’s more a discourse that they’re collecting additional data from other sources besides the phone."
This is a difference between the data collected by threads and the data collected by Twitter.
"I'm not all that tech savvy, and I gave up on Mastodon because it appears way too complicated. Maybe I just wasn't reading the explanations well enough, or didn't understand them - but then, that's a problem in itself. Anyway, I want something simple to sign up for, simple to get started with, and simple to use."
That's my primary problem with it as well.  UX matters.
"I agree 100%as much as I have generally been enjoying the platform it's an absolute mess and needs some serious changes/improvements to the user experience and onboarding. I think having some sort of more accessible method of server listing and discovery for new users would help dramatically, and I think being able to easily browse other servers through your ""home"" instance website would be really great. Right now it's fragmented a lot in ways that are unintuitive and off-putting for general users."
"Omg, you just reminded me Steve Job once on stage said something around they’ll open source their FaceTime protocol. Good times…"
 You are missing the /s but yup. :)
Dawg apple never promised to open that. It’s literally part of their strategy to other Android users.
"Could be, EU launch of Threads was delayed due to privacy concerns, supporting ActivityPub could be their get out of jail card here."
"Zucks just one of the guys, smoking meats out in his backyard. Very human, very normal."
"This is such a fucked up timeline where Disney and Zuck are actually looking like the ""good guys"" in comparison to their enemies"
Zuck is at least calm and collected. He doesn't throw tantrums. Being a billionaire and acting like a toddler is a bad look.
You can drop that last e. *But just barely*.
Maybe we were wrong and the fight between Zuckerberg and Musk occurred.
Zuck already had his shitty moments when he was founding the company and getting it up and running. Spying on all the college girls and being a general creep.Shit gets old after a while. Now he is married with kids and (appears) to want to just live a good long life.
What a great observation! ☝️
Why would one platform affect their whole ecosystem
"It's all dropship crap, just open up Alibaba and shop there, it's the same stuff without the markup."
"Assuming you use an iPhone, the last 2 years FB’s ad targeting is less precise due to Apples privacy change. But 3-4 years back they were crazy relevant with their ads."
But if you delete your account you do also delete your instagram account I believe.
"The accounts aren’t though. Those 70 million accounts are most likely overwhelmingly existing ig accounts.It’s a *very* different thing to get 3% of your user base to install a satellite app just to see what the fuss is about, where they’re automatically signed in because of the shared keychain, than it is to get 100 million folks to sign up for the service in the first place."
"Google also has an advantage of having a top cloud hosting platform (GCP) rivaling AWS and Azure, which helps with the cost of hosting the videos"
"Amazon has twitch, which is also a video based service that loses money but is profitable for a major data company."
Content library is another thing. The entire internets worth of instructional/educational/etc. videos are already on youtube.
"Sorry, but I'm Gen X, so to them I'm like a mummy from ancient Egypt."

"Yeah… my FB account dates back to when you had to have a .edu email address, damnit…. I’m not old! Get off my lawn!"
"I'll be 36 in 4 months, fuck I'll officially be old"
YouTube shorts not keeping up with it?
"Those are on Facebook too, weirdly it didn't replaced Facebook Videos, and now there are 2 types of videos on Facebook"
That ain't no infinity stone.
"The algorithm for reels on Instagram is so effective for me. Like I see some meme and the app seems to magically read my mind that I liked that meme, so it keeps feeding me the same kind of humor over and over. If there's anything I didn't have interest in, it stops feeding me similar content."
"Not to discredit the product, design, and engineering team there, but this is a clone product and in a well established product category. Even with a perfectly slick product plus all the missing features (DM, followed only feed) it could still be a mediocre launch. And Meta has many failed clone products in the past. What I _do_ give them credit on is around the focus on mainstream celebrities, creators, and _not_ focus on News Media which probably drives the most divisive and hated aspect of Twitter. That deliberate choice is smart. It’s personally not something I like (I want an RSS feed of hard core news) but we shall see."
What were libs saying that got them banned? Seems odd that libs whoPush hard for trans issues would go that route.
Well he apparently thinks posting comments is proprietary technology. Homie has no fucking clue. He got away with it for a few months because there was no big alternative. Threads being at 70m means it really is a twitter killer.

Nah you sound like a butthurt conservative. Libertarians don’t go around being Karens.
"> Claims no political affiliation, opposes censorship> Comments in /r/Conservative Yeah, ok, sure."
MEGA CRINGE
You said everything is nazism.
"Exactly, I hate people who are more successful than me"
"> It uses a *shitload* of data, too.Had that problem with Official reddit app. Good lord they should really focus on improving the app instead of getting as much data from you as they can"
Can you get your Facebook feed via API like what Reddit provides for a cost?
"No, not really. Conspiracy-addled righties really are full of shit. Not sorry."
It’s not censoring different opinions when the different opinions are Nazis
"People living in a bubble in Silicon Valley being given the power to delete anything to the right of ""hacker house polycule"" is a bad thing, yes."
Not sure that it is. It's just a new alternative at the moment. Threads still needs a lot of work.

"Yeah, it's like trusting TikTok."
Not a defense of it but Is Reddit different? People trying to wipe their Reddit accounts found their comments restored the next day. Reddit owns yours comments the second you hit submit.
"I work for a large-ish tech company. We take laws like GDPR seriously; the cost of legal action or not being allowed to do business in certain countries far outweighs the value of any data a customer has asked us to delete. Then again, my company makes money by selling services to users, not by selling user data to advertisers, so maybe the math is different for Meta."
"Oh no, he’ll have all my cat memes…"
GDPR?
"They have to, according to GDPR. Probably why they are yet to launch threads in the EU."
"Hey if you believe any site deletes any of your info ever, then your foolish. Nevermind Zuck."
That's exactly why it's currently not available in Europe.
"California has a mirror law to GDPR, the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).While there are some differences in terminology, the law covers most of the same bases and they specifically overlap in the data management rules, including the right to be forgotten."
"Does the law define exactly when a federated service must be treated as separate products?Meta gives you the ability to delete your account. It just so happens that the account is federated across to Threads. Sounds like something the courts would have to decide for themselves if it ever came down to it. I just feel like Meta has a pretty strong argument in that a user can request to have their information removed from servers (even if it involves removing your entire Meta account, and not just the service for a particular brand)&#x200B;edit: nvm someone answered my question down below, and the short answer is the law *does* define it"
"I stopped trusting Mark Zuckerberg when pressing the ""Delete Account"" button doesn't delete your Facebook account."
Aren't you glad for EU regulations?
"This did cross my mind as well, but I wasn't 100% sure if that was a factor required for the EU so I didn't mention it. If that is the case it's definitely going to come. Even meta knows that threads won't be successful in the long term by excluding the EU. Same reason apple complied with EU on USB C."

"Given that they can't launch the app in the EU at all until they deliver that feature, they have a compelling interest TO deliver it.  You're just writing bullshit to sound like you have some worldly knowledgeable opinion, but with no deeper thought underlying what you're saying."
Why try to defend your clueless and moronic statement?
"And if people already have Facebook or Insta... what extra data are they even getting? There was a comment further up saying something like 'raping you for your data' but I'm just sitting here in 2023 where my literal every move on the internet is gathered by someone, whether it's google, meta, reddit, or whoever else. VPN helps to some extent I'm sure... But like, why care what Threads does if it's already being done on every other free service."
"It's not just the US. They launched in over 100 countries.[The top 9 countries in the service they are ""replacing"" (aka Twitter) are not in the EU](https://datareportal.com/essential-twitter-stats). Japan has 51.5 million active Twitter users. France comes in at 10th place with 9.5 million users."
Because it's a lawless unregulated disaster.
">Storage systems have to be isolated? What an ignorant stone age take on software regulation.How tf is a stome age take?! Data security and in the event of failures would not affect more than necessaryAlso I don't want to make an Instagram account just to use Threads like seriously, why?"
"I could scarcely care if these tech companies get significantly less profit. The monopoly laws have been basically ignored in the field. Let them invest and innovate knowing what the guidelines are and following them. If there's profit to be made within the constraints, services will be provided. Yeah, let Amazon charge 350 a year and we'll see how it goes from there."
"This guy gets it. Meta dominates social media photo sharing through Instagram. They use that dominant position to create an unfair advantage and enter the microblogging market. This is the definition of what 90s anti-trust regulators were trying to prevent. Meta should not be allowed to leverage existing monopolies in the market to create new ones. Do we really want a world where Zuck owns a 90% market share of all social media activity across all streams and demographics? Because if regulators allow this “innovation”  to continue without scrutiny, he’ll get there by the end of the decade."
"Pretty sure local gov has property or cell records to track people without need of twitter, threads etc"
I'm surrounded by tech people for my job and no one explained how mastodon worked accurately to me I feel. I ended up having to discover it all myself. It's a solid idea but it's janky and not easy to explain which makes it basically impossible to mainstream atm

"Because FB stopped being able to track people’s iPhone usage, essentially.FB’s ad platform relies on a ton of individual data tied to each user to create a machine learning algorithm to decide which ads to show to which people on which platform at what time.Now, if you buy something on your iPhone, Facebook won’t be able to tell, so they’re losing a ton of purchasing data, which is the most important input to optimize the algorithm."
IIRC it’s the other way around

"Oh, not just more successful. There is an amount you can get through actually working and then there is an amount you get through taking advantage of others. ANYONE who is a billionaire is in this second group. Being a billionaire while people go unhoused and untreated is unethical, flat out. They are so wealthy that a submarine imploding visiting the Titanic or their private jet crashing or their yacht being attacked by killer whales are realistically the bad things that even could happen to them."
"Disable auto play and it should work fine, tho it might be something else. It helped a lot for me, just this month it ate like 331 mb which is nothing compared to the 600-800 mb per session (~1 hour) before I disabled it"
The official app used to just drain people's data allowance by constantly reloading the same gif/video over and over again.
"I cant provide the link bc this sub bans links to FB, but the facebook developer page has reference to how to retrieve user feed posts via Graph API. It's free to implement for anyone, just may need to pass permission checks since after cambridge analytica access to user data is a lot more sensitive. But in general, yes you could make an app without paying a cent"

No worries you’ve done more than enough thank you for the helpful tips kind stranger 🙏🏼
"Here you go, although of course we both know you'll find some convoluted excuse to dismiss it as somehow invalid or move the fences lolhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zm9q/elon-musk-twitter-nazis-white-supremacyhttps://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/bbc-panorama-research-misogyny-and-abuse-on-twitter-before-and-after-elon-musks-takeover/"
Its literally part of the app so you are either lying or not using the app.
"I just don't put anything on the internet that I don't expect to be public. If advertisers want to use that information to serve me more relevant ads, then good, maybe they'll figure out how to advertise the weird niche stuff that I like, but always seem to miss out on."
Threads is unavailable in the EU. Want to take a guess as to why?
"Ok, but who's holding them accountable. Does the EU send auditors around the world to check on what's being stored on servers."
"That's not true any more, they delete everything they don't legally have to retain after 90 days or something like that. It's law"
Wish we could get some of those.
Number of people does nor equal amount of profit. For example china has more people than every other country but usually isnt the most profitable because of the value of each user to advertisers.
"surprised saudi arabia is top 10, that's like a third of their population on twitter, more than a third of Japan is pretty crazy too"

"Because data lakes, data warehouses, and consolidation of data for business processes are core components of software companies handling big data. I honestly don’t see how Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc can even adhere to the regulation with how data is stored and having services across multiple apps. I’d be really curious how they implement their data stores to fit the regulation while also serving analyst needs to find insight in user data across apps. I would expect loading all that data at runtime and storing in memory for analytics would be expensive and time consuming. There’s probably a solution that I’m not aware of. Or some loop hole where it’s technically separate but really not."
Government has whatever they can seize by warrant or law enforcement letters. They certainly don’t have location history or demographic profiles (violates civil liberties).
I still think the whole thing was intentional like seriously wtf?

"Disney’s been in a big fight with Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis. Disney’s florida theme parks are in a “special improvement district” that was run by a board of Disney guys which basically means Disney got to self govern their own little town. The tradeoff is basically they get to dodge roll around some zoning laws and other local ordinances that would make operating a theme park difficult, and in exchange they handle infrastructure upkeep in the area. DeSantis has been trying to strip this authority from them because the company spoke out against some of his anti LGBTQ legislation. He’s since been quoted several times basically being like “yes this is me abusing my political power to single out and attack a business for being woke. I love to retaliate with targeted legislation”"
Maybe but wouldn't that only affect people on iPhones? It's not like the entire world has one

"https://restofworld.org/2023/elon-musk-twitter-government-orders/Here is the source report with a bit more detail. In reply to your comment, by the numbers, Elon Twitter is still more censored than before. It is not a place where, in your own words, a place people ""get to say what they want"""

I can really help if you'd like because I'm actually on the hiring side but it's up to you. Just redact your name.
"“Trending topics on Twitter are determined by the platform's algorithm. They can be tailored to the people you interact with, your interests, and your location. Depending on the view you select, you can see either what's popular on a broader scale, or what's trending within your specific interest groups”Like I said stop reacting to Tate’s fans and haters and you won't get any more notifications."
EU law prevents EU data being held outside of EU borders in the first place.

Bro can I take you up on this offer hahaha struggling out here
Ah yes. Because we all know that Elon hasn't changed a bunch of shit on wptwutter right? Videos cannot be removed or edited. it is integrated into that appears experience. I also never watched Tate videos. I never watch any videos on Twitter. So you can keep talking in circles but that doesn't change that Elon is actively amplifying the worst aspects of Twitter.     Open the app. Go to trending topics and you will see the recommended videos. At this point you just don't want to back down.

Who's calling you MAGA or Nazi?
I am telling you I see none of that.You're the one who wants to die on a hill you made.Do you think people in Japan see much of Andrew Tate for example?
because FB and reddit are completely different social media sites? this is like asking why didnt Blockbuster just start selling auto parts.
