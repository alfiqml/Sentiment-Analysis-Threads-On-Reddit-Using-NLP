Likely several months.If Bluesky can have a hard-launch in the next 2-3 months, and if they already have all the standard features, then I could still see them being extremely successful and overtaking both Threads and Twitter. Despite the astronomical amount of users that Threads has gotten in the past 24 hours, I have no doubt that many people who signed up today are rightly feeling uneasy about signing up for another Meta-owned platform. But of course, at the moment Meta is looking WAY better than Musk/Twitter so a lot of people are going along with it due to a lack of other options.If another option becomes available and offers the same level of user experience that people have become accustomed to on Twitter, then I do think a lot of people will happily switch over and eventually settle on a new app (like Bluesky).

And it's whatsapp because it became the default way of ""texting for free and sending pics"", for no other reason than inertia.For most people facebook is at BEST synonymous with corporate entities advertising by circumventing the advertising monetization practices (which btw is at the core of the recent waves of the plattforms finding ways to cash in on things kicked off by Musk and Twitter)I personally LITERALLY don't know anyone with a facebook page. And that includes my parents generation, my generation and their kids generation. With ONE exception, and that is exactly that kind of ""advertising interface"" for their business interests that theoretically eats into the advertising revenue of the platform.But then again where I live the whole concept of self promotion that plattforms LIKE facebook provide runs counter to basic understandings of what ""privacy"" means.Maybe the better phrasing of your point would have been ""outside of the US those that DO engage with that kind of service do it with facebook instead of the myriad of other options available""?

It ensures that EU citizens data is controlled under appropriate policies to protect and handle the data (such as no cross pollination, in the Threads example). EU citizens have the right to request the erasure of their data (right to be forgotten) from any org that stores their data and the org must comply. Users also have the right to decline or object to use of their data (with exception to legal/law reinforcement). There are a ton of other articles within the regulation about how processors must comply with restrictions and requirements of the data storing companies, etc. It bundles it all up nicely and makes data management policies very consistent across the entire EU, compared to trying to address each individual country’s requirements before it was implemented.Additionally, any breaches of personally identifiable data (name, address, ID numbers, and anything else that could be used to identify a person) must be communicated to an oversight board within 72hours and communicated to their users. Heavy fines are levied for data breaches/leaks/non-compliance. As an example, in 2023, Ireland levied a fine of €1.2 billion against Meta, because EU citizen data was transferred to the U.S. without adequate data protections.This is why some states, like California, have started to implement their own data protection policies, but the US is woefully behind in this area and our data is basically taken without consent, raped, and sold widespread to virtually anyone with the money to buy it.

(Tesla's autopilot notwithstanding, although that gives some idea of Musk's approach and in hindsight, was a red flag.)With Twitter, sure you can test the software before releasing it (although it's not clear how much they're doing that now), but you're not going to find out how successful it is until the users actually interact with it.

I doubt Mark Zuckerberg is any more eager to pursue those policies.The previous twitter leadership was much more traditional big corp, Pepsi, Disney, style with jumping on social bandwagons and taking  down things that the government doesn’t like (such as incorrect Covid info, some correct Covid info, and anything related to hunter biden true or false). That just isn’t Zuckerberg approach to social media and never has been. He goes based on what users like and engagement.I’m sure this will be successful, it might even be a better platform, but if you want a heavily controlled experience where you aren’t exposed to ideas that you dislike this probably isn’t it.Maybe the CEO not blasting stuff out there before thinking it through is enough to make people switch.

But, as I mentioned:1) the account deletion feature (which you called out) has 0 impact on subscriber growth2) Meta is a public company so they will have to release quarterly metrics on active users, which is what investors and advertisers *really* care about.And if we're talking about advertisers, what they care about even more than subscriber growth and active users is a couple of things that Threads will kick Twitter's ass at:1) Brand safety (Twitter is a dumpster fire)2) ROI on ad spend (Meta is the best in the business)So, TL;DR:\- Many apps have been created by Meta with shared login/network, but since they didn't thrive, you weren't even aware. Now that it worked, it was an ""unfair advantage"" and ""should be regulated"".\- Users want a serious alternative to Twitter\- Advertisers will probably much prefer this alternative to Twitter",Positive

Meta doesn’t sell your data because it’s super valuable to them. They allow brands to target ads to you based on the data you’ve collected. That’s completely different. How do I know? Look at Brandwatch and Talkwalker. Their business models are literally scrape and buy all data on the internet for the purposes of marketing teams to monitor their brand mentions (eg Pepsi wants to know who talks about Pepsi). The only companies that sell it to them are Twitter and Reddit and both have massive contracts with data audits about how the data can be used and moved around. Facebook and Instagram data they can only scrape first party data and what their bots can do, Meta tries everything to block this.I wish people would have more critical thinking around this stuff.

Two, actually – one in the US, and one in the EU; the latter of which gave us the Browser Choice window. These days you have one enormous conglomerate with a near-chokehold on the social media market – and people are cheering for it. And they are allowed to merge and acquire their way to total dominance, they are allowed to use one of their services to bolster another service, because why not; they are allowed to share data between their products, and they are allowed to make it so you can't delete one account without also deleting the other one. >What, you think if you become a threads user you are somehow now challenged if you want to open the twitter app?

Dorsey might have the wherewithal to re-launch Twitter, but he sure as hell isn't going to have 70 million users in two days. No other developer can compete with that. So, yeah. I fully believe that Instagram should be its own company. Threads should be its own company. Oculus should be its own company. They should operate independently, they shouldn't share accounts or data, and they shouldn't be allowed to do whatever they are doing right now.But unfortunately, we're not in the ""lawsuits for bundling a browser with your OS"" era – we're in the day and age where you can build a company that controls several of the most popular platforms on Earth and everything is hunky dory ;)",Positive
