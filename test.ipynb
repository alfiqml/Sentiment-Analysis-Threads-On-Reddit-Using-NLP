      "That's very common and not specific to Threads/Meta. With  cloud computing your data travels across many data centres and gets copied over and over again to ensure there's enough redundancy in case of \"disaster\" so that your data can be recovered. Meta like companies leverage a lot of other companies for their digital ecosystem (AWS, Azure, GCP, CloudFlare, Akamai, and so on) and that's before we consider that your data could be shared in many other places for marketing purposes. \n",

If a Threads user doesn't want their data lingering on other fediverse servers, they can post privately and keep their data within Meta's walled garden. Whether or not they trust Meta to actually delete their data upon request is another matter.\n",
      "Yeah that’s how real life works too. If you say something, you can’t unsay it. Even on networks that allow delete, there’s a good chance it’s already been cached, saved or screen shotted down the chain. Make an anonymous account and don’t be stupid and don’t tell people who you are. Never trust people on the internet that you don’t know. Can the feds track you down and know who you are? Probably through packet sniffing and ip tracing and the such, yes.\n",

      "Threads gives users full control the audience for their posts. You can post publicly, limit posts to only Threads users, or to any users (Threads + fediverse) that you have allowed to follow you. It is much more like email than Twitter is, and intentionally so. If you send someone an email, you can delete your copy of it but you can't delete theirs. You should be choosy about who you send emails to, and you should be choosy about which fediverse accounts are in your post audience. This is not a bug, it's a feature.\n",

      "Ah yes so the FB newsfeed experience lol\n",
      "That's what Instagram turned into. I used to follow friends/family and some creators that I enjoyed. Then then changes the algorithm to display paid content and ads.

You can tell they sort of rushed this out to capitalize on the anti-Musk appetite out there and they have a lot of work to do to add some fairly basic features to Threads. Which they have already confirmed will be coming but it’s going to take some time. Likely several months.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Bluesky can have a hard-launch in the next 2-3 months, and if they already have all the standard features, then I could still see them being extremely successful and overtaking both Threads and Twitter. Despite the astronomical amount of users that Threads has gotten in the past 24 hours, I have no doubt that many people who signed up today are rightly feeling uneasy about signing up for another Meta-owned platform. But of course, at the moment Meta is looking WAY better than Musk/Twitter so a lot of people are going along with it due to a lack of other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "If another option becomes available and offers the same level of user experience that people have become accustomed to on Twitter, then I do think a lot of people will happily switch over and eventually settle on a new app (like Bluesky). So while this is not ideal for Bluesky, they still have a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on this moment. They just need their app to be good, and to come before Threads can implement several missing features and before users begin to entrench themselves on Threads.\n",

Users also have the right to decline or object to use of their data (with exception to legal/law reinforcement).
